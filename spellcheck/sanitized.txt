 in the united states district court for the middle district of pennsylvania case number 404cv02688 tammy j kitzmiller et al plaintiffs vs dover area school district dover area school district board of directors defendants afternoon session transcript of proceedings of bench trial before honorable john e jones iii date september 28 place courtroom number 2 9th floor federal building walnut street harrisburg pennsylvania counsel present eric j rothschild esq witold j walczak esq stephen g harvey esq richard b katskee esq for plaintiffs patrick t gillen esq richard thompson esq robert j muise eq for defendants lori a shuey rpr crr official court reporter index witnesses for plaintiffs julie smith christy rehm beth eveland the following discussion occurred in chambers lets go on the record we are in chambers and this is the matter of kitzmiller of course versus dover area school district we have assembled as planned with respect to the issue of certain subpoenas that have been issued to reporters joseph maldonado and heidi bernhardbubb present in chambers are counsel for both the plaintiffs and the defendants and in addition to that let me ask that you enter your appearances specially presumably as counsel for the individuals we referred to in our orders collectively as reporters im here niles benn on behalf of both of the reporters heidi bernardbubb and joseph maldonado and with me is terance barna an attorney in my office as well all right now previously on september 12th the court entered an order which went to the motion for reconsideration that related specifically to filed by the reporters that went specifically to our august 2nd order which in effect said that the reporters would have to testify at certain depositions subsequently the reporters were if memory serves approximately eight days ago subpoenaed to testify by the plaintiffs in the caseinchief yet another motion to quash or for alternative relief was filed by the reporters through mr benns office by our order of last thursday the date escapes me i think it was thursday the court denied relief in that matter the court was advised that yesterday on september the 27th the reporters both of them showed up at the appointed times for their depositions as appropriately scheduled by the defendants and im advised and ill correct this if im wrong that both reporters cited the reporters privilege that they consider to exist under the first amendment so that they would not answer any questions at those depositions were brought here today by that as well as the fact that i presume youre here because the reporters have been properly subpoenaed to appear in the plaintiffs caseinchief now have i mischaracterized anything from your standpoint no everything that you said is correct your honor now the most salient question then is with respect to the reporters appearance today is it your understanding that the reporters are intending to invoke the same privilege cited by them yesterday if called when called to testify by the plaintiffs yes all right but thats the reason why i had asked if we could have this conference the floor is yours thanks im not here to discuss law i think we have discussed the law ad nauseam with respect to briefs argument i certainly understand the opinion and orders that have been rendered by the court and i appreciate them and i dont want there to be a misunderstanding in terms as to this case being wrongly focused and what i mean by that with regard to all of you in this room is that weve got approximately 40 people from the media that are observing this trial in the courtroom plus outside of the courtroom in speaking for myself it would be my humble opinion that if these parties were called to the stand to testify and refuse to testify as i just indicated to you your honor that i think the focus of this trial all of the sudden isnt addressed as to intelligent design but rather the media is going to be very much concerned in terms as to these stringers not fulltime employees not employees at all standing up for what they think is right and i really truly believe in my heart of hearts the focus gets misdirected i really truly do mean that because i dont think that should be the focus of this case as a result of that mr barna and i have spent days in an effort to try to see if there was a means by which we could somehow ameliorate the problem so that in a certain sense everybody gets what they want i clearly will not get what i want because at the end of the day if i agree that my reporters are going to testify predicated upon something that i want to propose here thats more than i would want because i stand by the fact and they stand by the fact that theres a reporters privilege here they refuse to testify at a deposition and my suggestion to them was that if we were capable of resolving something as a result of this conference that they would then attend a deposition because i believe the defendants would have a right to crossexamine them or otherwise examine them prior to them taking the stand and based upon that they would then testify in court but we have several issues one is that when we filed our motion to quash last week quite honestly we thought we did it in a timely fashion because we filed it only after we were served with the subpoena your honor summarily dismissed that motion to quash so in effect if my reporters were to be called upon to testify today by the plaintiffs theyre undressed theyve got no protective order at all theyre just regular people because the order i believe that you had previously entered related to the deposition and not related to their appearance in court so that raises an issue for us because clearly we would otherwise object to them taking the stand under the order as it currently exists or the motion that youre your position that the motion to quash could not stand i interpret the order and the amended order to mean that your honor in a sense has addressed them as fact witnesses i dont think you actually come out and use the word fact witnesses but as one reads the order thats the implication and you initially had indicated that you did not feel that the reporters privilege stood in this kind of a case these two newspapers respectively go to approximately 89 municipal meetings in terms of different municipalities and school districts and ironically in a sense i have to commend both mr maldonado and ms bernardbubb because again theyre paid per story they get anywhere between 40 and 50 a story they might make 300 400 a week if they write x number of stories and thats it and the stories that they write predominantly are municipal stories shes a fulltime mom shes breastfeeding she has a sevenmonth old child and so she works at night when her husband is at home hes a schoolteacher mr maldonado owns a little deli in the market in york and he homeschools his son his youngest son who has learning disabilities and hes been doing that for the last three years so this is just supplemental income to them because theyre not very wealthy people but yet without a lot of education in terms of journalism they believe that what theyre standing for is the right thing i dont have control over them as i would an employee of the daily record or the dispatch because they are stringers and independent so having said that their fear is that because of all those municipalities that they cover and the school districts that they cover that at least in the middle district court should a matter come up similar to this case then they are exposed as a fact witness ive related to them quite frankly this is the first case weve ever had in federal court in the years that ive been doing newspaper law and most of our cases are in county courts and so you know theres a different issue there but having said that the concern that i have is that there is a precedent being set in the counties that these people otherwise work so how do i make it better well we provided an affidavit and that affidavit indicated that we if called upon to testify would validate the authenticity of the articles that were written we did that in effect to offer to both sides so that we wouldnt otherwise have to testify accepted by the plaintiffs not accepted by the defendants defendants wanted to have the right of crossexamination and at the time when you wrote the original order and you used the words perceived saw and heard we were concerned as you well know with the word perceived in terms as to whats the thought process and there was dialogue on the phone amongst all of us and you made it very clear that you did not want any testimony that would otherwise relate to biases and prejudices and in fact when you reviewed the notes of the reporters you had also indicated that your review of heidi bubbs notes and the emails clearly evidence that there was no bias in the writings those writings the concern that we currently have is that the order reads in effect that they have to testify as fact witnesses predicated upon my interpretation as to what is otherwise unpublished material so that for example just using this for example thats not my intention no no but i well thats not my intention and i wanted to let you go as far as you could and i think i have to interject and i want to interject and i want to be clear because i think its important that i do that let me address a couple points that you made first of all i understand and deeply respect the position that youre in in this case and by saying that the motion was untimely it was not legally untimely it was untimely in my view only in the sense that it came as i said on the eve of trial when we knew that there was going to be an issue with respect to their testimony at trial it was an attempt to bring this to a head it was successful in that respect it was not successful in solving the problem but it was successful to bringing it to a head so to that extent i succeeded good bad or indifferent with respect to the point that you made as it relates to their testimony at trial that is a very valid point however i will tell you that the sense of my opinion as it related to their deposition testimony and as reconsidered and as honed in the reconsideration was that it was meant to apply the general thrust of that the protections if you will in that opinion were meant to apply in the same sense to their testimony at trial if they chose to testify and they would be protected in every way by the court and they would not be questioned in the broader sense so it would not revert back to an unprotected realm if you will at the time of trial to be as clear as i can be at issue in this case and i cant particularly be concerned about precedential value i understand your concern in that regard i have to try this case the best way that i know how the concern in this case and it is a vital concern by all parties is that we have as you well know to restate the obvious we have newspaper articles within which there are quotes from individuals those quotes go at least in one sense to the purpose behind the policy that was enacted by the dover school board the simple issue here because it is the courts understanding that these individuals have denied that they made these remarks is from the plaintiffs standpoint how can they get something that is in my view on the purpose test which clearly goes to the truth of the matter asserted how do they get these newspaper articles into evidence well they cant in my view without the reporters testifying the defendants might say that even with the reporters testifying they cant get them in i think thats their argument but at the very least in my view and i think the plaintiffs might agree with this the reporters would have to testify i didnt say this strictly in the opinion perhaps but my opinion was not meant to allow the testimony of the reporters to go in any way in particular outside the four corners of the affidavits rendered by the reporters i cant say that to the word and thats why the opinions were crafted the way that they were the court has to have some discretion on the questioning but i was as clear as i could possibly be that what is at issue here would be for example the particular events that the reporters wrote about and questions such as simple questions did they attend the meeting did they hear them say the comments did they write the story immediately after did they take notes at the time of the meeting i thought my opinion was clear in that regard and as you appropriately characterize no questions as to bias or motivation or reasons to misrepresent quotes would be allowed in there i believe we would decidedly fly in the face of established case law i did not view and do not view the law as providing that there is some exhaustion requirement although i understand some cases have said that in this particular fact situation and i do think i will say on the issue of precedent you can distinguish cases of and im not so sure i would be as fearful as some might be as to precedential value i think this case is somewhat distinguishable and i dont know that a judge in another situation would kneejerk allow this type of testimony we are in a very unique situation here and thats what we have finally the last thing that i want to do im answering soliloquy with soliloquy here im not sure if this is a dialogue finally i am acutely cognizant of the fact that this trial has abundant media coverage and it is surely not my intent to force a constitutional confrontation with two reporters and to create a side show that we dont need to thats why were meeting in chambers but ill tell you that if its their persistent position that they dont want to testify then well go on the record now im not going to put them on the witness stand i dont think its necessary to do that i would bring you and the reporters i will tell you to the bar i will swear them in i will have them sworn in i will ask you the question whether theyre going to testify i will allow them to speak for themselves on that point and then well decide what were going to do at that point i dont know what else to do but im not going to go through the charade of having them take the stand and assert you know as articulately as they can the privilege that they believe that they can avail themselves of thats fine i interrupted you but i think it was necessary to do that well let me share with you why i have the issue that i have about a week and a half ago i had a telephone dialogue with eric because i had proposed to eric the possibility that in light of your most current order and because you took out the issues of biases and things of that nature and because were going to be called to trial by eric that maybe he should be speaking to pat to see whether they would be willing to accept the affidavit in lieu of the testimony i think were beyond that well and then what happened was we had a conference call eric pat several others in pats office and myself and terry they indicated that they would not and then in the course of that conversation the defendants counsel had stated for example we would like the opportunity to ask if they heard mr so and so say something why didnt they write that thats what im concerned about with respect to im not going to allow that question but you werent at the deposition meaning you dont know that that question wouldnt be allowed and quite frankly yesterday you were in trial i said though very clearly in the last order i thought in the september 12th order that i would be available and i thought when i heard that the reporters quite frankly appeared for depositions that when i was on a break i was going to hear an accumulated list of questions that were objected to and that i would have to rule on those questions now i dont have time to preside over a deposition at this late date and i know that you respect that youre experienced counsel and you know that i do know from my private practice experience that i was extremely loathed to get a judge on the telephone in middeposition that could be one of the most unhappy experiences that a lawyer would have you got it depending on the time of day and the personality of the judge especially after your last opinion on my case i dont want to call you at all as you see im far more genial than i express in writing what i invited by that opinion though was that i would be available and i believe in an issue that is as important to the reporters and to you as their counsel as this it is appropriate for you to stop a deposition on a question like that instruct your witness not to answer and allow the court to rule on it i was inviting you to do that now i understand what your reasons are for not doing that and i think you can do that now if youre telling me that you have problems with certain anticipated questions but not others and if youre telling me that the reporters would not exercise the privilege if they were kept roughly within the confines of their affidavits i go beyond that im willing to have them testify as to what they wrote in the article and basically forget the affidavit thats fine that means everything thats set forth in that article well then i think weve clarified that point then i think you should reschedule the depositions and try to do that well if i can interject i mean this is kind of like my last hurrah we could only hope not it depends what happens next week because we dont have an order with respect to trial testimony and we dont except for the fact that again theyre naked ill produce that order if necessary well let me share with you where im coming from because i think what ive done here and obviously i cant do your job but what im proposing here if you could just evaluate it depending how long this trial goes you might be my guest in terms of doing my job all im doing is adding something to what it is that you basically have already written and if i could just read this you have no idea how long it took us to write this because i think it does exactly what you just said it says wherein an affidavit is provided in lieu of testimony to support a newspaper article or newspaper articles the reporter shall be obligated to testify as to the facts set forth in the articles ie what was seen and heard as related in the newspaper articles by doing so the reporters would be verbalizing the contents of said affidavit i think actually they were your words when we had the telephone conference by testifying as to what appears in the newspaper article or articles unless such affidavit is otherwise accepted by all parties as validating and authenticating the contents of the newspaper article or articles in issue meaning if they accept it it becomes moot however no testimony shall relate to unpublished material or information or to the reporters motivations bias mental impressions or other information extrinsic to what the reporter saw and heard and the reporter shall not be obligated to reveal any confidential sources what ive tried to do here is to say theyll testify as to everything that appeared in those articles and how i then distinguish this case from maybe my next case is where an affidavit is provided and the court or the parties dont accept the affidavit what ive done is it says that theres no extraneous unpublished material questioning thats the clarity that i need and then quite frankly my mindset is if the issue of the defendants is that we were biased in our reporting because we either misquoted somebody or whatever well this isnt a jury trial youre trying this case youre either going to believe the reporters or youre going to believe mr buckingham or mr bonsell or whomever when they say i didnt say that but my concern is that i have to have some degree of certainty by your order that they cant ask any questions as to unpublished materials are you suggesting that this language should apply to both the depositions and the trial testimony meaning if you could adapt language similar to this for the trial testimony and i agree i have no problem in them being at a deposition prior to trial with the same kind of language relative to that i will appear at a deposition prior to trial i would like to do that because of my own health conditions maybe on friday in terms as to a deposition if that works within anybodys schedule and then maybe the latter part of next week because what i did was i put my surgery off until next friday to get this done well the problem friday i assume you fellows are getting out of here on friday but im not sure of that or we could do it monday i mean whatever works well we do have friday morning off right although you may have something scheduled in terms of pretrial planning im not sure do you know i have a plane flight i was not going to be here do we need the whole team i was the one going to take the deposition yeah ed was there yesterday alternatively well well do what we have to do scheduling usually isnt my pay grade but you know you can figure that out go ahead judge if i may there are some things here that we can agree with but there are others that we cant and this is why in our opinion judge you know if our clients are believed the reporters did talk to them but took misrepresentative statements so that they left things out to put them in a false light and in so doing have created articles that if they were admitted for the truth of the matter asserted would be misrepresentative well thats what im not going to get into and i understand and i respect that argument but i think ive got to linedraw here someplace and i understood that argument before and what i dont want to do here is turn this into an oral argument on things that ive already decided and i know you respect that i think there is a privilege here and i think the privilege sometimes gets drawn in what appears to be an ad hoc manner but my job is to find where to put the line down in this case to traipse into the area of why they selectively used a quote as opposed to not using other things that were said i think is to get on a very slippery slope it really almost precipitates a bias line of questioning and im not going to allow it i am trying to narrowly draw this i understand that thats not what the defendants want in this case but i dont think its called for and as a matter of fact i think if i did that and i ordered that and if i assume that the reporters would not testify and i would predict if it went to the third circuit on that basis i would be reversed i dont think that thats a fair area of inquiry to get into this looks artificial when youre dealing with a fact witness but these are fact witnesses who are also reporters and i am straining to try to find a fair way to do this i believe that to the extent and ive said this now several times that the reporters testimony is necessary in order to invoke the residual hearsay exception under rule 807 that the defendants have to have an opportunity to examine the reporters on the same topics and subjects that i would allow the plaintiffs to question them on during their caseinchief nothing more and nothing less so im inclined to accept this language you know not word for word only to the extent where it states rather generically wherein an affidavit is provided i would take that sentence and simply say that affidavits have been provided rather than wherein its somewhat artificial or a little strained as it relates to this case the rest of it i dont have any problem because i think it does not do violence to my opinions and this gets into a semantical exercise to some degree but one that is important i understand to the reporters we have got to cut the gordian knot here either we can live with this and they would testify if we had language similar to this well my intention would be to enter an order that is a wraparound order if you will that is in effect a rereconsideration of the order on the depositions but also speaks to the trial testimony in chief and it will be abbreviated because of the time constraints on me but well issue it forthwith and it will indicate that youre going to theyre going to sit for depositions under those circumstances can i ask whether that would be reported in what sense when you say reported what do you mean by that reported meaning in the books oh published when you say reported and youre talking about reporters then im thinking i have enough work in this case no we wouldnt publish it but there are reporters who can access the cmecf system no the reason why im asking whether it would be published i dont know whether your original opinion youre worried about the precedential value no its not my intention to publish it i have no need however good or bad news travels fast and in the legal realm it will be cited by somebody someplace you have no idea oh youd be surprised your honor just in an effort to avoid needless procedure or inquiry if i could just get a sense for what you have in mind and intend by the order if they show up for deposition and begin to testify about an article about june 14th hypothetically hypothetically would we be at liberty to say did you hear anything else did you see anything else no because and i know this is difficult but it goes like this and this is the best i can put it other than what i tried to do in my opinion we have articles we have a situation where the declarants the quoted individuals have apparently denied either denied i guess im not sure about this this is my understanding either denied that they said what was reported in the articles or said that they were statements taken out of context and they can speak for themselves and thats one of the reasons that im linedrawing here they can say that and ill take that under consideration but from the reporters perspective were they at the meeting the obvious answer is yes but they havent answered that under oath did they hear the statement that is included in the article perhaps where were they standing in the room did they utilize a tape recorder for the purpose of taking down the statement or did they use a tape recorder and did they take notes contemporaneously with the statement how long after the meeting did they write their article did they use the tape recorder did they use notes as it related to that statement those are the types of inquiries that relate specifically to the contents of the article to allay mr benns concerns i think it is not fair game to talk about all the other things that they heard and why they wrote the article the way they did and why they excluded quotes i sincerely believe that that gets into journalistic integrity and thats problematic and its not my intent to allow that nor would i allow any questioning on anything personal to the reporters i think i spelled that out in detail in the prior orders we are going to simply have them testify for the purpose of authenticating the contents of that article nothing more nothing less because i really believe that to do more than that is to create i think a precedent which would have reporters called mr benn i think fears that even this would do that i dont share that fear but to go any further than that would mean that a reporters veracity could be questioned each and every time something like this comes up i strain mightily not to have to do that thats what im talking about now i dont know if that clarifies it it does your honor i think in large measure and i would ask this with your leave would it suffice to preserve my objection that i object here in chambers on the record thats fine and i note that and thats why i wanted to do this on the record and i understand that you object to that and i understand the defendants have interposed not only this objection but they have also argued against that and to the extent that this really clarifies and reasserts what i have in my prior orders i think youve preserved your position as it relates to that and i understand that position thank you anything from the plaintiffs we have no objection to the proposed modification your honor all right so with that brief change to what is a little bit awkward in the first sentence the wherein and i dont mean that facetiously but just as it relates to this case because this almost looks like its a contracted or i understand i just wanted to make sure the word affidavit was in there we will recite that we will get a clarifying order out now for the purpose of because this is a very public trial whats your intention what are your thoughts regarding how we should address this because its known that this is a festering controversy thats an interesting question i mean if were not called today which were not going to be i dont know that it really is an issue we just had dialogue in chambers the judge is going to be entering an order and after we receive the order well be able to make a decision in terms of where we proceed well i dont know about that i think you can assume unless you doubt my word im going to issue an order and im very serious im going to issue an order and that order will be forthwith i would prefer that we can say that weve restricted the order in such a fashion that we believe the reporters will testify if i might be so bold that we are satisfied with the resolution thank you we expect an order that is consistent with our understanding of an agreement that we reached i will let it to you to address that and my intention would not be to address this again in open court this afternoon we would just move on you have other witnesses i assume to present and we can move through this im simply saying i dont want wiggle room that were waiting to see because ive had that experience now before if you indicate to me as you have that this is satisfactory to you i will indicate that we are satisfied with the prospective order that we understand the court is going to enter and that our clients will be testifying at deposition and at trial because ill adopt this but i dont want to do this again i understand and you dont want to do it again i know i recognize your honor just one other clarification question with regard to asking what they saw and heard with regard to all of the statements and the articles i would assume thats statements made after the gavel banged and the meeting was over some of those quotes are afterwards yes but can questions be asked as far as the context of those statements the court ask the question that you want to ask when so and so said this thing you know it was in response to what what question or what else was being talked about when this statement was made no thats too amorphous a question the issue here ill restate is the veracity of the articles themselves did the reporter hear the statement as reported if it was taken out of context were not going to delve into that in this examination the individual who believes who was quoted and believes the statement was taken out of context or flatly that he didnt or she didnt say it and its inaccurate will have the opportunity to say that during the defendants caseinchief or at any other time during the trial were not going to side door you know a bias argument by going into context context is a dangerous thing as it relates to what were doing here so no its we presume that the statement was likely given to the reporter upon a question being asked by the reporter although it could have been volunteered thats of no moment the issue is did the reporter hear the statement was it reported adequately not was it reported out of context but did those words as quoted come out of that individuals mouth now i cant be any clearer than that all right your honor one thing i might ask since it is perhaps likely that issues are going to arise during the deposition im wondering if we could now attempt to schedule the deposition at a time when everybody including your honor might be available to intercede well whats your next day that would be available if not friday monday well monday ill be in chambers in williamsport all day i cannot do it monday because i couldnt get here on sunday my wife is going out of town and i have to watch all the kids i could do it tuesday i could do it wednesday tuesday and wednesday is a jewish holiday for me i cant do it how about tomorrow im leaving tomorrow well look if its any weekday other than next friday when i will not be available ill be traveling next friday ill be available and you know well work through that issue and if youre otherwise taking the deposition and were at trial ill tell you that well construct some mechanism and we kind of talked about this a little bit yesterday where you hold the thought if counsel instructs the reporters not to answer because its a problematic question and we can circle back and well deal with that later i understand those things could come up in the course of the deposition and ill rule on those as i can if im not instantly available so whether im sitting at trial or not and likely it will be a day when im sitting in trial well deal with it how about later today you work that out lets get back on the record here because weve got people waiting and i want to get going youll have to work that out but i will tell you in concluding that if it is at night if you do it at night i will give you my home number and you can contact me so we get this finished if we have to do that well do it so we get it finished i will not attend the deposition though i stopped doing that when i got this job anything else no thank you your honor thank you your honor the discussion in chambers was concluded we return in session and i want to apologize to the assembled spectators and of course to the media we handled a matter in chambers that youll become aware of in an effort to resolve a problem and i think we did these things arise during trials from time to time that is the first time that weve had that type of matter in this trial we may have others as the trial unfolds but it was a necessary exercise and we try to keep them at a minimum and we will keep them at a minimum during the trial but with that we will go back to the plaintiffs you may call your next witness your honor the plaintiffs would call julie smith julie smith called as a witness having been duly sworn or affirmed testified as follows direct examination by mr harvey please tell us your name julie ann smith where do you live ms smith honey run drive york pa and is that within the area covered by the dover area school district yes it is and how long have you lived there fourteen years do you have any children yes i have two children how old are they my daughter katherine is 16 and my son michael

summarize for us your educational background i graduated high school in 1979 and i graduated at york college with a degree in medical technology in 1984 now did there come a time when you learned that the dover area school district board of directors was considering approval of a biology textbook yes and tell us when did you learn that i learned that in june of 04 and what was the basis for your knowledge i read it in the paper do you remember what you read yeah i read it in the york daily record and yes i do remember please tell us what you remember learning at that time that the school district was very concerned about approving a biology text that did not include creationism and do you remember anything else that you learned at that time not right off the top of my head okay did there come a time when you learned that the school district board of directors had approved a biology text yes they did in august and what was the basis for you learning that at that time i read about it in the paper and did there come a time when you learned that the school district board of directors was considering a supplemental textbook yes and what was the basis for your knowledge of that i learned that from the paper also and what did you learn that they were going to have of pandas and people in the classroom as a supplemental text to the biology book and did you learn about where that book was going to come from it was donated now did there come a time when you learned that the board had made a change to the biology curriculum yes and approximately when was that in october i believe it was in 04 it was in the newspaper that they were going to be teaching their intelligent design from of pandas and people and did you attend that board meeting no and did you learn anything else from reading the newspapers at that time well that they were going to read the statement in the classroom yes okay now id like to ask you to take a look in the notebook at whats been marked as p127 yes can you tell us what it is its the newsletter that came to the house in the mail that told that had the statement included that they were going to be teaching in the biology class now do you know approximately when you received this well it says it was february so im assuming it was february did there come a time when let me withdraw that do you believe that the boards actions in this case the change to the biology curriculum and its other actions have caused you harm yes i do and can you tell us what harm you believe that it has caused you late in 04 my daughter came home from school and i was discussing kind of what was going on in the district with her and she looked at me and she said well mom evolution is a lie what kind of christian are you anyway which i found to be very upsetting did you ask her why she said that yeah i asked her why she said that and she said in school what they had been talking about or amongst her friends and whats going on she seemed to be under the impression that as a christian she could not believe that evolution was a science that you know was true and how did that harm you well it goes against my beliefs i have no problems with my faith and evolution theyre not mutually exclusive no further questions of this witness all right crossexamine mr thompson thank you your honor crossexamination by mr thompson mrs smith my name is richard thompson i represent the defendants in this case and do you recall in april where your deposition was taken by another member of the thomas more law center patrick gillen do you remember being involved in that deposition yes i do were you present in court for all the testimony that has been given in this trial no when did you get to court tuesday morning now whose testimony have you heard so far i heard some of ken millers i heard barrie callahan bryan rehm i heard the gentleman this morning okay you were asked to become a plaintiff in this case by the aclu were you not no didnt someone from the aclu call you yes they called me but i was actually asked by my friend at work who said to me would you be interested in having the aclu contact you and i said yes and so the aclu contacted you and you agreed to become a plaintiff in this case yes now will you agree with me that the policy which is the subject matter of this lawsuit the curriculum change in the biology for ninth grade took place on october 18th 2004 yes thats when the board passed the resolution that changed the biology curriculum i believe so yes and that policy was implemented for the first time in january of 2005 is that correct thats correct in january 2005 where was your son my son was in college so he had already graduated from dover high school yes thats correct and in january 2005 where was your daughter she was in school what grade she was in grade ten so you will agree with me that this biology curriculum really only affected as far as the statement was read ninthgrade biology students no thats not true so the statement was read to other classes no but it would affect all the students at the school well listen to my question this policy provided that the statement was read to ninthgrade biology students do you agree with that i agree it was read to ninthgrade biology students okay and your daughter had already graduated from the ninth grade thats correct so at the time that this policy was implemented both of your children were out of the ninth grade thats correct neither one of them would be subject to the statement being read to them is that correct thats correct okay now you indicated to your lawyer that you got involved because of newspaper articles that you read thats correct okay now is it an accurate statement that in the year 2004 prior to you becoming a plaintiff in this case you had never attended a single board meeting thats not correct in 2004 in 2004 thats correct okay just please answer my question and then your attorney can ask you to explain if he wants to so in 2004 prior to this prior to you becoming a plaintiff you never attended a board meeting in that year in that year okay before that yes in 2003 you never attended a board meeting is that correct no i had attended board meetings previously i didnt ask you that question i asked you in 2003 did you attend a board meeting im going to say i dont remember which board meetings i attended in objection arguing with the witness and beyond the scope im asking questions excuse me and beyond the scope of direct wait wait one at a time let him finish mr thompson finish the objection objection arguing with the witness and beyond the scope of direct i dont find it beyond the scope of direct its appropriate crossexamination its overruled on that basis were getting argumentative only because i think the witness and counsel are talking over each other each of you let the other finish before you start talking i apologize your honor theres a great temptation in crossexamination to talk over that happens so lets get a question on the floor why dont you restate your question mr thompson okay by mr thompson is it true that you did not attend a board meeting in the year 2003 im not going to say thats not true i dont remember which board meetings i attended i did attend some before 04 is it true that you didnt attend a board meeting in 2002 i told you i dont remember which year i i attended board meetings during the construction project so when that was thats when i was there and that was the year 2000 was it not i dont remember mrs smith im going to hand you your honor may i approach the witness you may by mr thompson mrs smith im going to hand you what purports to be your deposition that was taken by patrick gillen i would like you to direct your attention to page 13 and i would like you to read out loud the question that you are asked starting with line 18 and all the way down through that page and then going on to the next page page 14 and reading from line 1 through line 4 and please read it out loud you want me to read out loud starting on 18 line that starts with q which represents the question that was asked by mr gillen and a represents your answer would you please read it out loud let me just make sure i get you there and go on you attended board meetings give me a sense of which ones you attended they were not the board meetings now give me your answer so that the record will reflect that was the question and now your answer starting with line 21 you want me to read it yes they were not the board meetings and we were not discussing intelligent design when i went to some board meetings it was several years ago we were discussing the building project and it has nothing to do with the intelligent design and then go on to the next page and the question that mr gillen asked you starting on line 1 that is all i am trying to get a sense for i am not familiar with the dates for the building project was that 03 or 02 was that 2003 or 2002 is that right the question thats correct okay and what was your answer i would say more like 2000 so was that an accurate reflection of your memory at the time that the deposition was taken yes okay does that seem right that the board meetings that you attended prior to being a plaintiff in a lawsuit was in the year 2000 if thats what i said thats what i recalled at the time yes so based upon the response that you gave to your attorney is it a fair statement that you began as a plaintiff in this case in december 2004 without ever having personally witnessed the actions of the dover school board as they debated and enacted the policy on which this lawsuit is based mr harvey objection its compound by mr thompson can you answer that question now wait shes not going to answer it until i rule on the objection elaborate on your objection i think there are several predicates to that question he asked whether you were present at any of the board meetings while they debated and then enacted this resolution and im not aware of any testimony that they debated the resolution well i think its a fair characterization that there was discussion about the policy ill overrule the objection you can answer the question do you recall the question no lets have the question read back please previous question read back thats correct by mr thompson in fact all of the information upon which you strike that in fact the information that you were getting about what the school board was doing in 2004 came from newspapers is that correct thats correct and i believe in your deposition you indicated that you looked at the morning newspapers almost on a daily basis thats correct and when you were looking at the morning newspapers that you got very upset about what you read regarding the dover school board and the policies that they were debating is that correct thats correct what were the two what were the newspapers that you were looking at during this time i read the daily record every morning what about the york dispatch not regularly no okay so that it would be a fair statement that even though what you were reading in the newspapers got you upset that you never personally attended one of the board meetings in that year thats correct there were personal issues in my life at that time where i was not able to do that and it is true that you never spoke to any of the members of the dover school board about the issues that concerned you is that correct thats correct you never called them is that correct thats correct you never emailed them is that correct thats correct did you write letters to the editor about what the school board was doing no so that the first time that the school board would know that you were upset with their actions is when they learned of you being a plaintiff in this lawsuit is that correct thats correct okay now did you ever speak to any of the teachers at dover high school before you became a plaintiff in this case no did you ever speak to any of the reporters who had written the stories about what the dover school board was doing during this time no did you ever receive any minutes or notes about what the dover school board was doing during this time no you never sent anyone emails or any other communication regarding this issue is that a fair statement thats a fair statement in fact one of the issues in this case is this book of pandas and people is that correct thats correct you never looked at the book of pandas and people before you became a plaintiff in this lawsuit did you i didnt feel that i could look at it it was in i guess it was in the library at the school but i was not aware if we could go in the school library and take out books or not well did you make any effort to go and look at it i really wasnt interested now your attorney referred to a newsletter that you received in february do you have a copy of that newsletter in front of you yes and i believe you indicated that you thought the newsletter was sent in february 2002 no excuse me 2005 excuse me correct okay could we have that newsletter i would like you to read from that newsletter on the top lefthand side in that box read it out loud please this newsletter has been produced to help explain the changes in the biology curriculum unfortunately a great deal of misinformation has been spread regarding this policy we hope this publication will help those interested better understand the substance of the policy while eliminating any misconceptions some may have about the curriculum change we sincerely appreciate your understanding on this matter thank you it was through this policy that you first learned about the statement that was going to be read is that correct no i believe no i heard about it before but did you actually see the statement before i dont think so so this was the first time that you saw the statement that was going to be read to the students in the ninthgrade biology class is that correct i believe so okay as far as i can tell and so this newsletter was actually providing information to the residents of dover as to what the actual newsletter was excuse me what the actual statement was going to say is that correct yes okay so you had no problem with the fact that the newsletter was being produced even though you had a problem with the policy is that correct no now theres a bit of street wisdom and i dont know whether you agree with this or not and that street wisdom is dont believe everything you read in the newspapers have you ever heard that yeah ive heard that before okay and so if you dont believe everything in the newspapers dont you think before you became a plaintiff in a lawsuit that you should have taken some personal action to verify whether things that were produced in a newspaper were really accurate i did talk to people in the district other people in the district who did you talk to people that i work with other people in the district but you never even saw the policy until that newsletter came out is that correct i got my information from the newspaper yes and the newspaper now have you ever had involvement with newspapers before have you been interviewed have you been interviewed by news reporters before no but would it be a fair statement to say in the normal experience that newspaper reporters might spend five ten or fifteen minutes interviewing a person and then only put one line of that interview in an article objection no foundation that she has any experience as referred to in the question do you want to respond to that mr thompson well i think its common experience and its knowledge its common sense now i think were going afield ill sustain the objection were now clearly outside the scope of direct the objection is sustained by mr thompson well you said that you were upset by the policy because it conflicts with your religion i said i was upset about it because i didnt find a problem with it with my religion it does not im getting confused i have a problem with it because my daughter came home from school and she says to me what kind of christian are you anyway so thats why i have a problem with it if you recall your deposition and i certainly will give you an opportunity to look at it if you dont recall it the incident that youre referring to also you received information that your daughter was a member of a bible club right yes and up to that point you were not even aware she was a member of a bible club isnt that correct thats correct and that it was she had a lot of friends who went to protestant fundamental churches is that correct yes she does and she received that information from her friends her protestant friends in school or in the bible club isnt that correct i would assume thats where she got her information from the bible club at school plus they talked about it and the fact that someone believes in intelligent design does not make that inconsistent with the catholic faith does it i spoke to my deacon about this situation and all i know is what he told me is he a theologian hes a deacon at st rose catholic church do you know if he has any particular expertise in catholic theology objection again beyond the scope of direct your honor she brought the issue up of religion your honor and im exploring that well i think it is beyond the scope again the colorable scope of direct and ill sustain the objection this is not a deposition this is testimony in the caseinchief and were afield by mr thompson now the book of pandas and people you dont mind that book being in the library do you no i dont have a problem with it being in the library you heard yesterday if you attended the deposition of excuse me the testimony of mr rehms that the science teachers in a compromised move had agreed to put of pandas and people in the science class did you hear that objection your honor mischaracterizes the testimony in what sense i believe mr rehm testified that the teachers did not agree to put the materials in the science class your honor my understanding in and now wait mr harvey let mr thompson speak one at a time your honor my memory if it serves me correct mr rehm testified that they had reached a compromise with some of the board members that they were going to allow the book of pandas and people in the science classroom my recollection is that he may not have used the word compromise he may have used the word concession im not sure that theres a distinction as it applies here ill overrule the objection did you hear mr rehms testimony yesterday yes well then go ahead by mr thompson whether its concession or compromise did you hear that the teachers had agreed to put of pandas and people in the science classroom i dont remember exactly what he said yesterday no further questions your honor all right thank you mr thompson any redirect no your honor then maam you may step down that will complete your testimony and i dont think we have any exhibits to enter do we thats correct your honor p127 is already in evidence you may call your next witness your honor the plaintiffs call to the stand plaintiff christy rehm christy rehm called as a witness having been duly sworn or affirmed testified as follows your honor again may i make sure that she has the binder of exhibits you certainly may direct examination by mr harvey please tell us your name christy rehm are you married mrs rehm yes tell us the name of your husband bryan rehm please clarify for us one important question and that is exactly how old are your children my children yes i have a 14yearold daughter alix an eightyearold daughter paige a sevenyearold son ian and a 15monthold son lucas and where does your family live i mean your immediate family you and your husband and your children rock creek drive dover pennsylvania and how long have you lived there approximately five years and had you lived in dover previously to that in your life yes i grew up in dover i attended dover high school graduated from dover high school my family my extended family lives in the dover area including my grandparents my parents and other relatives my parents currently still live in the dover area and please tell us where your children are right now in school the grades please grade level okay yes the oldest is in ninth grade the next one is in the third grade i have a firstgrader and then obviously the baby is not in school yet and the oldest three children do they attend the public schools in dover yes two of them my oldest is at the high school the dover high school and then i have the next one is at the weiglestown elementary school and my son is hearingimpaired so he is charged with the education of dover school district meaning that they have to provide his education but he actually attends classes at a hearingimpaired classroom and your daughter thats in the ninth grade is that at the dover high school yes and is she taking biology now yes she is please summarize for us your educational background as i said i graduated from dover high school i attended lock haven university and millersville university i received a ba from millersville university in english and i also have a degree in journalism as well i later got a teaching certification and attended penn state university where i received my masters degree do you work outside the home yes i do what do you do im a teacher an english teacher where do you teach in a public school system outside of york county and what grade do you teach highschool level so tenth through twelfth grade generally did there come a time when you learned that the dover area school district board of directors was considering a change to was considering approval of a biology textbook yes do you remember when that was it was sometime in 2004 it was prior to the june meetings because my husband was a teacher at the school so i often heard things that he would come home and tell me so i knew that there was some discussion over the biology book so sometime before that i cant tell you exactly when did you attend a meeting of the dover area school district board of directors on june the 7th of 2004 yes i did and why did you attend that meeting well because like i said my husband had been a teacher at the school and he had sort of been directed by the high school principal to attend the meeting in support of the different things that were happening there were other textbooks that were being adopted and controversies over them and you know it was sort of a rallying thing i suppose and i went along because i live in the district i pay taxes in the district my children attend school in the district im an educator and i was curious about what was happening and can you recall anything that happened at that meeting on june the 7th i recall a lot of things that were happening at that meeting please tell us what you can remember about that meeting okay some of the i attended a lot of meetings so facts blur together what i do recall i as my husband said yesterday i was pregnant at the time so i have some reason to remember certain things but i recall barrie callahan speaking about the textbook it was the first time that i had really ever been around barrie callahan so she strikes me that memory strikes me because my mother had known her previously and she was speaking about the textbook just questioning them i dont remember her exact words but i do know that she was upset with them about this textbook the textbook process the students not having a textbook obviously it was very distressing for her that the students in the biology class did not have a textbook do you remember if any board member spoke back to her in response to her questions yes bill buckingham said to her and i know bill buckingham because at the time he lived down the street from my grandparents and for many years lived there and he responded to her basically saying that theres you know a problem with the textbook it needs to be balanced comments about laced with darwinism it needed to be balanced with creationism comments of that nature is what he had said to her do you remember im sorry im sorry and i distinctly recall barrie callahan sort of throwing her hands up in the air and saying oh so this is about evolution that was very distinct in my mind just her mannerisms as she said that do you recall a young man by the name of max pell speaking at that meeting unfortunately i was in the restroom at the time that max pell was speaking because my husband told you i was eight months pregnant i was actually nine months pregnant and due any day so i spent quite a deal of time in the restroom but i had excused myself to go to the restroom just after barrie did this whole thing in fact i may have been walking out of the room at the time and in close proximity to her and so at the time when max was speaking i believe that there were people who spoke in between she and max pell but at the time when he stood to speak i was in the restroom and sort of coming back from the restroom so i dont really recall exactly what his comments were i know him because he was my husbands student though do you recall any other board members saying anything during the course of any discussion about the biology textbook well like i said i was reentering the room from the bathroom so i was sort of in the doorway and i obviously didnt know what max had said to the board but that he had spoken to the board so the comments that were coming back were i assume directed at him but there were comments from bill buckingham about brainwashing and i remember hearing that the whole thing about brainwashing because it dealt with going to college and getting this education and students who go to college become brainwashed and i was very upset by that because i attended college and i dont feel as if i were brainwashed and also i recall alan bonsell making a comment about you know there are only two theories theres this theory evolution and theres this theory creation and if youre teaching only those two theories then theres not a problem do you recall anything else mr bonsell said at this time no do you remember anything else that was said by any members of the public at that meeting at that meeting currently i dont id like you to take a look at whats been marked as exhibit p46 its in the notebook in front of you just take a moment to look at it okay do you have that in front of you yes have you ever seen it before this article yes did you see it at or around the date that it was published yes i did whats the date on it the date is june 9th 2004 who is the author the author is joseph maldonado and can you tell us what publication its from yes it is from the york daily record now did you just have an opportunity to read it just a moment ago just now i skimmed it yes take another moment to look at it if you need to but i would like to know whether it refreshes your recollection about anything else that happened at that meeting yes okay tell us what else after looking at that article do you remember anything else that happened at the meeting yes i do recall bill buckingham making comments about you know the apes and monkeys coming from apes and monkeys and i also your honor again objection it appears shes going to be reading from the article with her testimony im sorry its a little hard to do this but well sustain the objection mr muises objection is wellfounded let me explain how we can do this how we must do this when your counsel asks you the question you may review the article take a look at it see if it refreshes your recollection its important that having refreshed your recollection if it jogs something or recreates a memory that you testify in answer to mr harveys question do not look back and read from the article as youre testifying please all right yes sorry by mr harvey now do you remember anything else that happened at that meeting yes i remember comments about our country being founded on christianity and not needing to teach the faiths of other people and i remember talking to my husband about that in the car ride home as well because were both teachers and i was when i hear things like that i immediately think of my students and i was thinking about the diverse group of students that i have in my classroom who all have different religious viewpoints and how difficult that would be to tell one student that you know we cant express your belief but we can express that persons belief in the classroom and i just find those things to be very upsetting when i hear things like that being said now do you remember if you attended another meeting of the dover area school district board of directors approximately a week later on june the 14th yes i did and why did you attend that meeting well because there wasnt really a clear resolution to what had occurred the previous meeting in addition i was very angry when i left the june 7th meeting just because of the demeanor of the school board and the things that were being said and honestly i thought that maybe it would set me into labor because of you know being angry and at that point in time i was past my due date in addition to caring about my childrens education and everything i said previously now tell us what you can recall of the june 14th board meeting again there were many many things that happened at that school board meeting and i can tell you that i was very much interested in what was being said and so i pretty well made sure at the beginning of that meeting which went on for quite a long time that i wouldnt miss anything so i took care of my bathroom needs beforehand and i recall the meeting starting with bill buckingham sort of im sorry trudy peterman spoke about her actually hold on give me one second to think about this yes trudy peterman spoke she was the high school principal at the time and i know that she spoke because the thing that she said seemed very similar to her graduation speech that she had said just previously my sister had graduated that year and i attended the commencement ceremony and she had talked about visigoths and things like that that she had spoken about in her commencement speech and essentially she was speaking up for the teachers and the biology textbook and after she had spoken bertha spahr also spoke as well shes the department chairperson and actually i had her as a science teacher and she presented information to the board documents that she and i believe other members of the science department had researched on i guess cases that had been set down before on creationism in the public school system or something of that nature just to show them that you know if they were still considering this idea that they might i dont know be met with some litigation or something after she spoke bill buckingham had made a comment to her about her where did she get her law degree from can you give me one second im wondering if im getting my meetings mixed up objection your honor this is running into a narrative well i think its still responsive to the question do you want to put a question on the floor she was just thinking by mr harvey did you need to think and change your testimony in any way i just wanted to make sure that i wasnt getting my meetings mixed up you can finish your answer do you want to finish the answer or is that your answer yes thats my answer im sorry i recall something else as well i recall charlotte buckingham who is bill buckinghams wife speaking at that meeting as well essentially there were a lot of people in the community who were standing and speaking at this meeting because they wanted to warn the school board that they were not in favor of any legal action coming against the community against the school board they were afraid for their tax dollars and charlotte buckingham i recall really being the only person who got up to stand in defense of the school board and she was mr buckinghams wife or is mr buckinghams wife and she quoted scripture old testament actually all old testament scripture about why the school board is right basically and she also talked about school prayer and the need for school prayer in that speech that she had prepared in addition reverend warren eshbach stood up and spoke at that meeting as well sort of urging the school board not to proceed with this and many other members of the community spoke as well by mr harvey did your husband speak i recall my husband speaking in fact he hadnt prepared to speak but he was very upset as many people in the audience were and he stood up to speak i dont remember his exact comments but again it was a warning to the school board and actually not necessarily a warning but just sort of reiterating what science teachers do in their science classes and how there is really no conflict here with the textbook objection your honor its a narrative the question was did your husband speak yes he spoke my next question was going to be simply if you could tell us what but i think shes already told us what she can recall her husband said well that answered the next question that moots the objection and you can move to the next question by mr harvey do you remember bill buckingham speaking at this meeting oh yes there were not many meetings where bill buckingham did not speak and actually at that meeting i believe the beginning of the meeting was an apology actually which he had prepared in advance apologizing to the members of the community if he had said anything that offended them and it seemed to me sort of an inappropriate apology because or maybe inappropriate is not the correct word but not a sincere apology because almost immediately after he had given his apology he started doing the same things that he had always done which was to demean the public to say negative comments do you remember specifically anything he said yes he made comments like years ago someone died on the cross cant we take a stand for him he made comments about the liberals in black robes coming and taking away our freedoms in the school he made many many comments at that meeting now did you attend any other meetings of the dover area school district board of directors that summer no we didnt attend that summer and did you attend any meetings that fall yes did you attend the meeting on or about october the 18th of 2004 yes we did and can you just tell us briefly what you can recall about that meeting well there was at this point in time it was the change in the curriculum that was being proposed and voted on that evening and again this was a heated meeting there were many members of the community who stood to speak science department members jen miller spoke although i didnt really know who she was at the time i recall her speaking on behalf of her biology course i recall bertha spahr again speaking my husband again spoke at this meeting and again other members of the community spoke at that meeting did you and your husband stay for the whole meeting no we didnt now during the time that you were at the meeting did you hear any discussion among the board members about the reasons for the proposed change to the biology curriculum during the board meeting yes no did you attend a meeting the following week on or about november the 2nd 2004 yes and can you remember anything from that meeting yes i recall noel weinrich who had spoken at other meetings as well was upset about the vote that they had taken and was sort of urging them to rethink the vote do you remember anyone requesting access to oh yes a tape of the october 18th meeting yes because my husband and i had left early we had our infant with us and he needed to get home we had heard that there were comments that were said after we left about teachers should be fired if they dont listen to the school boards directive and we wanted to hear that for ourselves so my husband had previously requested the tapes and then at that meeting he stood again to request the tapes in addition barrie callahan had stood to request the tapes at that meeting as well and do you remember if any members of the school board spoke in response to either your husband or barrie callahan with respect to the subject of the tapes yes barrie im sorry alan bonsell said very clearly that dr nilsen had said something as well about the tapes that its not policy or something like that that this is not past practice this is not policy this is not standard policy to release tapes to the public and additionally alan bonsell made the comment that they couldnt release the tapes because after speaking with their solicitor there would possibly be legal issues ramifications if they released the tapes now id like to just ask you just a couple more questions mrs rehm do you believe that the boards actions with respect to the change to the biology curriculum have caused any harm to you yes absolutely and can you please tell us how you have been harmed well in numerous ways first as a teacher professionally i feel that teachers in general are harmed myself as well because theres a dichotomy here in what theyre saying about this statement that they have passed on intelligent design as theyre not teaching it on the other hand theyve said that it enhances state standards and critical thinking in my mind everything that you do in a classroom is teaching and i dont necessarily think thats just in my mind i believe thats true of all educators the way i dress when i go to work tells my students something the statements i make or the statements that i do not make in my classroom tell my students something so i think were charged with you know having an ethical decision to make when we walk into the classroom the things that we say and the things that we do and so i think thats very important but you cant say when you walk into a classroom youre not teaching and if thats whats happening in the dover school system and my children are in that school system that theyre routinely establishing practices that is not teaching in the classroom then thats shameful in addition i have a child who is in the ninthgrade biology class and this has spilled over into other classes its not just the biology class that has been affected by this my child has heard comments from other students school board member students in her classroom about evolution being against their religion and do you think we came from monkeys how can you think we came from monkeys it used to be a weekly occurrence its now a daily occurrence and my daughter comes home from school upset about these comments that are being made to her and you know is looking for guidance on how to respond to these questions also intelligent design is not a scientific concept its a religious concept and because i dont subscribe to that particular brand of religion i feel that i and my daughter my family are being ridiculed and my daughter feels the pressure i reserve the right to teach my child about religion and i have faith in myself and in my husband and in my pastor to do that not the school system thank you no further questions all right before we start the crossexamination i think this will be an appropriate time for our afternoon break well take that break for approximately 20 minutes no longer than that and we will return with mr muises crossexamination of the witness well be in recess recess taken mr muise you may crossexamine thank you your honor crossexamination by mr muise good afternoon ms rehm your oldest child is 14 years old is that correct yes and your childs name is alix yes and alix is presently in the ninthgrade biology class at dover high school yes she is and my understanding from your husbands testimony yesterday is that she hasnt yet reached the section in biology that deals with evolution is that correct yes after looking at her syllabus it appears that evolution comes later in the course i wouldnt say at the end but closer to the end of the course and so she hasnt heard this oneminute statement be read in the class yet she has not no now you testified about two or several meetings but two meetings in particular i want to ask you some questions about and those are the meetings that occurred on june 7th of 2004 and then the meeting on june 14th of 2004 okay yes i believe you described these meetings as involving some heated exchanges between some board members and the public is that correct yes and its my sense from your testimony that the majority of the statements that you appear to find objectionable were statements made by mr buckingham no there were statements made by many of the school board members that i found objectionable its just that mr buckingham always seemed to say very inappropriate things but in addition alan bonsell said very inappropriate things and noel weinrich said very inappropriate things its just that i didnt give much credit to noel weinrichs comments because he would say things like darwins at least what 60 years old a theory becomes a theory if you say it over and over again those are the kind of things he would say but they were all very outspoken now the controversy on the june 7th and june 14th meeting was surrounding the selection of a biology textbook correct june 7th and june 14th yes yes and the biology textbook that was in question at the time i believe it was the version of the millerlevine biology book is that your understanding it very well could be im not sure what the edition in debate was but the statements that you testified to and the controversy that you were describing was surrounding the purchase or selection of that particular biology book for the school district correct yes it was definitely the millerlevine textbook i dont know what the edition was or the copyright date or any of that information but i do know that it was that biology textbook that was being debated very rigorously and in fact the school district purchased the millerlevine biology book to be used as the primary text for the ninthgrade biology class correct yes and that would be the textbook that your daughter alix will be using yes with the dragonfly on it she already has the book she has the book yes have you looked through it have i looked through the book yes i have looked through the book do you have any objections with the book no i dont she wasnt given a copy of pandas and people was she no she was not so the only required textbook for that class was that biology book that was creating all the controversy on june 7th and june 14th is that correct to my knowledge the only required book is that book in addition to supplemental materials that the instructor has now you made a comment in your direct testimony that intelligent design conflicts with your brand of religion yes is intelligent design another brand of religion no what im saying is that i believe intelligent design as well as the ideas of creationism in particular the young earth creationists which im sorry i dont agree with dont agree with the age of you know the earth and their opinion there are things that i do not believe and i do not believe the same things as the board members who adopted that statement and so your understanding is intelligent design is the same as young earth creationism well to my understanding intelligent design just presupposes that everything in life is too complex that it has to be designed but i also know that creationism was used repeatedly with the term or im sorry not with the term intelligent design intelligent design came up after the fact but i do know that in its original context it was creationism that was being used and when i think of creationists again i think of young earth creationists and i do not subscribe to that way of thinking and so again youre associating young earth creationism with intelligent design there is a connection in my mind yes if you could be shown that intelligent design does not require the action of a supernatural creator and in fact is based on observable and empirical facts would you change your opinion i believe that if intelligent design could be proved to be scientific then i would believe it would belong in a science classroom would i believe it i dont know that scientifically im qualified to say you know that i believe many scientific concepts because im im not a scientist but i suppose that if intelligent design could follow scientific methods then and it were proven to be scientific by scientists it was accepted by scientific communities then i would have no reason not to accept that i want to explore your understanding of what has actually taken place in this ninthgrade biology class that your daughter alix is presently taking is it your understanding that darwins theory of evolution will be taught in this class pursuant to the pennsylvania academic standards i would hope so and as far as i know that is the case because dover says that it is a standardsbased school and so i assume that when they say that and they say that students have to pass certain material before they can be advanced into new material that they would have to be abiding by the state standards and i take it from your answer you have no objection to that to following state standards no i have no objection and so its your understanding that the pennsylvania state standards require students to learn about darwins theory of evolution and eventually take a standardized test of which that theory is a part of it yes the pssa test yes and you have no objection to that to my students taking a pssa test well you know i being an educator im not in love with pssa tests or standardized tests but if youre asking me if i object to my daughter taking a standardized test with that information on it of course not i would hope that they would provide lots of academic information on those tests and is it your understanding that because dover is a standardsdriven district that theyre going to focus their class time on preparing students to achieve proficiency on those standardbased assessments im sorry can you repeat that yes is it your understanding that because dover is a standardbased district the class instruction is going to focus on preparing students to achieve proficiency on those standardbased tests that we were just describing not only is that my understanding but that is what i would expect and you have no objection to that no i dont is it your understanding that because dover is a standardsdriven district that students will not be tested on the intelligent design theory as i know it and as it is written there is no test on intelligent design and from your previous answer i believe you do understand that the dover school district purchased for its ninthgrade biology class the edition of the miller and levine biology book correct yes and you have no objection to that book being used in the class no i do not is it your understanding that this biology book provides thorough coverage of darwins theory of evolution actually did you ask me if its my understanding or if if its your understanding i mean you have to testify about your knowledge maam okay what ive seen of actually darwin in the textbook in my opinion is actually quite slim it follows state standards of course and actually to me it gives more of a historical context of darwin than anything as far as what i have read and i did look at that section and i looked basically through the book and it appears to be historical mainly in context of darwins time frame and what he did for science has dr miller left the courtroom maybe we should ask so if youre asking me if i feel its enough or if its im not sure what it is youre asking me about that i feel actually that there are topics that probably could be explored in more detail but i understand that there are limitations within any textbook that you have to hit on core concepts i believe that core concepts are covered but i think that in my opinion what ive looked at its historical context is it your understanding that it presents darwins theory of evolution in a manner that is consistent with its standing in the scientific community as much as i know about the scientific community and you know you have to remember thats not my discipline but as much as i know about what the high school science standards say it would be in standing with that as far as the scientific community i really cant go there because i know that there is a lot more about darwin than is in that textbook i mean i can absolutely say that without knowing everything about darwin or knowing everything about science do you have any reason to believe that whats in the biology book is inconsistent with what the scientific community absolutely not no no i would have no reason to believe that is it your understanding that the book of pandas and people was placed in the library for students to review yes its your understanding that no student was required to read any portion of the pandas book right just as no student is required to read anything thats in the library unless they choose to you have no objection to pandas being in the library no absolutely not i dont object to pandas being in the library just like i dont object to you know any of the other books being in the library as long as as long as its the appropriate level and you know i mean there is a censorship process that goes into putting books in the library so i mean as long as it has gone through that process and its approved to be there i dont have a problem with it being there the statement that the school district developed to be read as part of the biology class is it your understanding that the statement that was drafted in january 2005 or for use in january 2005 was modified in june of 2005 are you aware of that can you say that again im sorry i wasnt that precise the original statement that was drafted by the dover school district was modified in june of 2005 are you aware of that well im aware that that statement was modified several times in fact there were different drafts of that statement that i had seen the exact modification are you telling me that from the time that they had approved it in october it was modified before it was read in january because it was again read in i believe like may and there was a change from that point in time unless im incorrect and that is the change that im thinking of were you aware that there was a change made to the statement at one point to indicate that pandas was in the library as well as additional resources in the library addressing intelligent design yes i am aware that there was a change are you aware of that change yes is it your understanding that some of these additional books that were put in the library are actually critical of intelligent design actually i am because i recall them an organization actually sending the library those books because there was controversy in those books being put in there too and there were many members of the community who had called to see whether those books had actually gotten there or not into the library because we werent certain that those books were going to be allowed in the library permitted in the library theyre in the library well a parent the books that are critical to yes im assuming that they had gotten there you never checked there were a couple instances where friends of mine had tried to check on the status of the books in the library but were not permitted to go in at that time so i am only assuming that those books are there now because i am being told that they are but as for myself walking into a library and seeing them there i did not do you have any objection to these additional books being placed in the library no i do not no further questions your honor any redirect no your honor maam you may step down that will complete your testimony and you may call your next witness your honor plaintiffs call to the stand plaintiff beth eveland beth eveland called as a witness having been duly sworn or affirmed testified as follows state your name and spell your name for the record sure my name is beth eveland beth eveland direct examination by mr harvey please state your name beth eveland and where do you live ms is it ms or mrs mrs mrs eveland colonial road dover pennsylvania and how long have you lived there ive lived there approximately eight years now are you married yes i am do you have children yes i do how many children do you have two and how old are they i have a sevenyearold daughter and a fiveyearold daughter and what schools do they attend they attend the leib elementary school in the dover school district and do you have plans for your children to continue to attend public schools in dover yes i do and what are those plans to continue keeping them you know going through the dover school district and do you work outside the home yes i do and please tell us what you do i am a legal assistant now did there come a time when you learned that the dover area school district board of directors was discussing or considering approval of a biology textbook yes and when was that it was approximately june 2004 and do you remember how you learned that i had read an article in the york daily record now id like you to look at whats been marked and is in the notebook before you as p46 all right excuse me your honor i just want to make sure that this testimony to the extent it relates to the newspaper article is subject to our standing objection well what is 46 its a june 9th article from the york daily record well i dont know what the question is it may relate to your standing objection but well note that well hold that thought and you can proceed with the question because all we have is the exhibit that is a newspaper article so lets proceed with the question theres no need to restate your objection unless you want to put a finer point on the objection but at this point proceed with your question by mr harvey did you read this article on or around june the 9th of 2004 yes i did and following reading this article did you attend any meeting of the dover area school district yes i did and approximately when was that approximately the end of june through the present what id like to know is if you attended a meeting after this june 9th excuse me this board meeting thats reported in this article yes i did and what was the date of the next board meeting that you believe you attended it would have been approximately june 15th june 16th and can you tell us whether when you remember that you attended this board meeting when i remember that i attended this board meeting yes in preparation for trial looking back through my deposition testimony and thinking about things that had happened it occurred to me that you know i was there at that june meeting and what is it about that june board meeting that made you remember that you were there i remember casey brown one of the board members at the time discussing during the board meeting with the board that she felt they were im paraphrasing treading you know on they were treading closely to violating the pennsylvania state board of education regulations on religion in the classroom and do you remember anything that was said by any board members at that meeting that you attended in june of 2004 yes i do what do you remember i remember bill buckingham making the statement years ago somebody died on the cross cant someone take a stand for him now what was your reaction to what you saw and heard at the board meeting on or about i think you said june the 15th or 16th i think for the record its established that its june the 14th but tell us what was your reaction to what you heard i was shocked i was just utterly shocked and did you do anything in response to that yes i did i had wrote a letter to the editor and was that before or after you attended that board meeting i wrote a letter to the editor i believe it was actually written before i attended the board meeting but it wasnt published until after that june 14th board meeting and where did you send that letter to the editor which newspaper i submitted it to the three local newspapers york daily record york sunday news and york dispatch and did you do anything before you sent it to those papers with the content of the letter yes i did i had emailed a letter basically stating the same thing in my letter to the board president at the time alan bonsell a copy to dr nilsen and i mailed a copy to mr buckingham now please turn to whats been marked and is in the notebook before you as p56 okay do you have it in front of you yes i do and can you tell us what it is it looks to me to be a copy of a letter to the editor that i wrote and im going to ask you to read this letter into the record okay objection your honor this letter is hearsay say it again im sorry objection hearsay why is it hearsay shes going to be reading in the letter the contents of the statement its an outofcourt statement theyre obviously offering it for the truth of the matter who wrote the letter she wrote the letter overruled by mr harvey please as a parent in the dover area school district i must convey my shock and utter dismay at william buckinghams comments regarding the search for new biology texts for the high school i am especially upset with mr buckinghams comments as quoted in wednesdays york daily record this country wasnt founded on muslim beliefs or evolution this country was founded on christianity and our students should be taught as such this statement is in direct contradiction to the mission statement of the dover schools in partnership with family and community to educate students we emphasize sound basic skills and nurture the diverse needs of our students as they strive to become lifelong learners and contributing members of our global society what a slap in the face to many of the parents and taxpayers of the dover area how sad that a member of our own school board would be so closedminded and not want to carry on the mission of dover schools his ignorance will not only hold back children attending dover area schools but also reinforce other communities views that dover is a backwards closeminded community if it was simply a matter of selecting a text that gives two contradicting scientific theories equal time that would be an entirely different matter but its not creationism is religion plain and simple mr buckinghams comments offend me not because they are religious in nature but because it is my duty to teach my children about religion as i see fit not the dover area school district during a biology class now that letter was actually published in the paper yes it was and did you see it in the paper yes i did and did you read any response to your letter in the paper yes i did and can you tell us who submitted whose response did you read in the paper it was a published response noting heather geesey as the author and who is heather geesey she is a member of the dover area school board and her response letter was published in what newspaper i believe it was either the york dispatch or the york daily record and please turn to whats been marked in the notebook before you as p60 okay does that help you remember looking at it what newspaper it was published in it was published in the york daily record and what is that thats marked as p60 it is a letter from heather geesey to the editor in response to my letter and did you see it at the time yes i did please read that into the record objection your honor our standing objection as well as she has not established a foundation that actually heather geesey wrote this article she has no personal knowledge let me first view the exhibit do you want to respond to the objection yes your honor we submitted an exhibit list to the other side and we were told there were no authentication issues with respect to any of this so theres no question about the authenticity of this nor do i understand and further its not offered for the truth of the matter asserted so theres no hearsay objection well on the authentication lets take it in two parts my understanding was that there was not an authentication issue that does refresh my recollection on that point now if theres not an authentication issue well move on to the second actually mr muise may be at a disadvantage here i did agree with steve that we he has an affidavit from someone who has indicated they have collected newspaper articles so with respect to that issue theres no objection i have agreed that she has authenticated what she did to produce this article all right very well so theres no question then that this represents a letter written by ms geesey to the york daily record is that correct from the defense standpoint that is correct your honor thats the representation that has been made in an affidavit and i accept it now counsel for the plaintiff is indicating the letter as being produced on the issue of or to show notice obviously on the effect prong do you want speak to that your honor i would also note that its an admission of a party opponent and i think it would come in under that basis but that would be the hearsay justification or the justification that would get around a hearsay objection but the purpose of the letter is under the second prong is that correct it is for that purpose and its also to show that ms geesey talked about the statements that were made in this letter at this time thats one of the issues in the case so it could go to truth inasmuch as its an admission is that correct exactly all right your honor as you know weve got the question of whether or not these are admissible for effect our position on that weve articulated i dont know if you want us to argue at greater length or brief but its hearsay to the extent its offered for the truth of the matter asserted as effect well i think that you reserved that argument weve had that discussion im inclined because its a bench trial ill admit it conditionally whether ill consider it in my ultimate determination will be a function of the argument that im allowing you to reserve and make but for the purpose of this witness conditionally and subject to additional argument from counsel well admit the letter and you may proceed thank you your honor by mr harvey please read the letter this letter is in regard to the comments made by beth eveland from york township in the june york sunday news i assure you that the dover area school board is not going against its mission statement in fact if you read the statement it says to educate our students so that they can be contributing members of society i do not believe in teaching revisionist history our country was founded on christian beliefs and principles we are not looking for a book that is teaching students that this is a wrong thing or a right thing it is just a fact all we are trying to accomplish with this task is to choose a biology book that teaches the most prevalent theories the definition of theory is merely a speculative or an ideal circumstance to present only one theory or to give one option would be directly contradicting our mission statement you can teach creationism without it being christianity it can be presented as a higher power that is where another part of dovers mission statement comes into play that part would be in partnership with family and community you as a parent can teach your child your familys ideology and what was your reaction to that letter when you read it in the paper mrs eveland that really concerned me why that made me question first of all was she writing on behalf of just herself or on behalf of the whole school board since it was signed dover area school board director and i sensed a religious intonation now id like you to tell us did you attend board meetings in after june yes i did and which board meetings did you attend all of them and do you believe that were you at the meeting on october the 18th of 2004 yes i was and did you hear the board discuss any reason for adopting the proposed curriculum change no i didnt do you feel that youve been harmed by the boards actions yes i do and please tell us how you believe that you have been harmed by the boards actions i feel its my duty as a parent to introduce any kind of faithbased concept to my children not the dover area school district while my children are small you know this policy is districtwide and theres nothing to prevent it from being trickled down into the elementary level its just something that i feel strongly that my husband and i thats our task to bring faith to our children thank you no further questions all right crossexamine mr muise crossexamination by mr muise good afternoon maam good afternoon you said your oldest child is seven years old yes she is and what grade is she in shes a secondgrader so shes seven years out from attending the ninthgrade biology class at dover high school thats correct now you have an interest in science is that correct somewhat yeah i believe in your deposition you indicated in your daytoday events you try to spark your childrens interest in science yes i do and you believe its important to make science interesting for your children yes i do you dont have any specific training in evolutionary theory correct no i dont i want to get a sense for what your understanding is of what is going on in the ninthgrade biology class that your daughter will be attending several years from now is it your understanding that darwins theory of evolution is going to be taught pursuant to the state academic standards it is my understanding yes and that students will be tested on subjects that are based on those standards including the theory of evolution yes that is my understanding and its your understanding that the students will not be tested on the theory of intelligent design that is also my understanding yes is it also your understanding that it is a standardsbased district so classroom instruction will focus on achieving those standardbased assessments in which they will eventually be tested on yes and intelligent design is not part of those standardbased assessments as far as my understanding yes it is currently not and these board meetings that you attended in june the controversy was surrounding the purchase of a biology text for the class correct yes do you know which book it was that the controversy was about i believe at the time it was the miller and levine biology text and isnt it true it was mr buckinghams objections to that biology text which precipitated some of these statements that you were referring to in your direct testimony thats correct and what action did the board actually take with regard to the biology book well with regard to the biology book with regard to the biology book for the ninthgrade class its my understanding that they held off on the vote in june because there was a new edition that was going to come out and they wanted to get the most current book instead of wasting money on an older book and so they ended up purchasing the version yes they did yes they did have you seen that book i have briefly looked at it now my understanding is you went to these board meetings in june because of the controversy over the biology book yeah part of it you said you just skimmed this biology book that was at the center of the controversy it was available on the table where the board was sitting and i went up front and took a look at it for maybe a minute or two in those two minutes that you spent actually looking at the book that was the center of this controversy was there anything in that twominute review that you saw that you objected to no i just basically looked through the table of contents quickly is it your understanding that that book that was eventually purchased by the dover area school district covers the theory of evolution consistent with its status in the scientific community thats my understanding yes now these meetings that you attended would you describe them as being fairly contentious fairly contentious yes shouting matches i believe the term you used in your i think a circuslike atmosphere would be quite appropriate now is it your recollection that the first time the pandas book was mentioned was during the july meeting that you attended i remember it being mentioned i cannot give you a specific date the dates run together after a while how about mentioning the theory of intelligent design do you recall when you may have heard that theory first mentioned to the best of my recollection it was first mentioned june july sometime at the time it seemed that creationism and intelligent design were kind of used handinhand interchangeably during these public comments that precipitated some of those statements that you were referring to was it your impression that mr buckingham and mr noel weinrich were taking the comments as being personally directed toward them not only them but the vast majority of board members yes they were so they saw them as being personal attacks against them yeah now the first meeting you attended in july you spoke with joe maldonado correct yes and i believe the first as i testified earlier the first meeting i actually had attended was the second meeting in june i guess my question is the first meeting that you attended in july yes i had spoken to joe maldonado and who is joe maldonado its my understanding he is a reporter with the york dispatch and during this conversation he approached you and asked if you had read or were familiar with some comments that he had quoted in the paper and those were mr buckinghams comments correct yes he had and he asked you what your thoughts were about those comments yes he did and he also asked you if you would ask for mr buckinghams resignation on the spot correct thats correct and you told him that you didnt think that was going to happen i told him that i would just sit back and wait and see what happened and your sense for why he asked you this was that you thought he was trying to elicit something sensational for his paper there is that possibility of trying to elicit something sensational but i think he was also trying to prepare for what might happen later on in the meeting since they tended to denigrate in shouting matches may i approach this witness your honor the court you may by mr muise maam im handing you what is your deposition testimony that you gave on march 28th of 2005 and id like you to read if you look on page 64 read from line 18 through 25 and then well continue on the next page once you finish that the first board meeting i attended in july he approached me before the meeting started and asked if i had read the if i was familiar with the comments that were quoted in the paper i told him just simply what i had read he asked me what i thought about it and i said the comments i dont feel that is appropriate he asked me if i asked for mr buckinghams resignation on the spot i told him i didnt think that that was going to happen and the next line line 3 is a question which states when mr maldonado asked you that question do you have a sense for why could you plead read your answer which is lines 5 through 8 yeah based on what was quoted in the paper yeah i think he was trying to elicit some sensational whatever for the paper it was my first board meeting i just wanted to sit back and see what would happen were you testifying truthfully during that deposition yes i was to the best of my knowledge youve had additional discussions with mr maldonado about the happenings with the board correct yeah and you also had conversations with ms heidi bubb yes and shes a reporter yes for which paper shes a reporter for the dispatch i said earlier mr maldonado was for the dispatch i believe he is actually a reporter for the daily record i believe you testified in your deposition that after the complaint was filed you actually spoke with ms heidi bubb quite a bit yes at the board meetings well i dont recall whether or not i did say after suit was filed but ill take your word for it if its in my deposition testimony im sorry maam could you i said i dont recall whether or not i did say that i had spoken with her after suit was filed i mean if thats what it says in my deposition testimony thats what i testified to at the time lets go to page 68 of your deposition transcript maam okay on line 16 the question was asked can you recall generally when you spoke with her and in reference of the if you look above its referring to ms heidi bubb can you read what your answer was on lines 17 through 21 she would generally approach me after the meetings especially after the complaint was filed i spoke with her a lot she would ask me occasionally my thoughts public comment what i thought why i thought the board was doing what they were doing those such things now back in july or august 2004 you had communications with the national center for science education yes i believe you joined the listserv yes and you also had a discussion with them regarding an interview with the ap it was a brief email exchange but yes did you do that interview no i did not maam do you understand that the statement thats going to be read to the students in the ninthgrade biology class was modified in june of 2005 yes i do and do you understand that that modification indicated that the book of pandas and people would be in the library along with other resources regarding intelligent design yes and is it your understanding that those other resources included books that are actually critical of intelligent design yes do you have any objection to that no i dont now you testified about the harm that youve received based on these statements and the comments and the actions of the board id like you to go to your deposition transcript if you could to page 101 okay if youd read from line 16 which presents the question until line 2 of the next page question is there anything else that the board has done here in connection with the curriculum change that provides a basis for your complaint answer from what i can see from attending the board meetings i dont know because so much of the curriculum debate takes place at nonpublic meetings that i am not aware of and when board members are questioned at meetings they really dont answer any questions so it gives this whole illusion of secrecy to the process which you know may be a big part of the problem it may just be a big misunderstanding were you testifying truthfully when you answered that question yes i was no further questions your honor redirect no your honor all right then maam we thank you you may step down this is probably an appropriate time for us to end today we will do so by admitting the exhibits that we need to if we need to p46 is the york daily record article i assume were going to withhold admitting that pending further proceedings is that right mr harvey yes well move it in after another witness your honor p56 is the witnesss letter to the editor are you moving for the admission of p56 yes your honor now youve stated an objection to that the objection is noted you dont have to restate it and i will note the objection do you have any additional objections you want to make to that not at this time your honor thats it all right its admitted subject to the defendants objection p60 is the letter from school board member geesey to the editor again i think i noted that it was admitted over the objection already of the defendants well reaffirm that but you can make any other objections you want to on the record but i think that was thoroughly argued at that time thats correct your honor all right we will reconvene a little later tomorrow at 930 am because of some matters that i must attend to and the session will go longer with everybodys indulgence i would expect to go to approximately 5 oclock no later than 5 oclock tomorrow to make up for the time that we lose during the morning session so we will stand in recess until 930 am on thursday we thank you all whereupon the proceedings were adjourned at 420 pm certification i hereby certify that the proceedings and evidence

 no 01618 in the supreme court of attorney general washington dc the united states wednesday october 9 2002 the aboveentitled matter came on for oral argument before the supreme court of the united states at 1003 am appearances lawrence lessig esq stanford california on behalf of the petitioners theodore b olson esq solicitor general department of justice washington dc on behalf of the respondent well hear argument now in number 01618 eric eldred v john d ashcroft mr lessig oral argument of lawrence lessig on behalf of the petitioners mr chief justice may it please the court petitioners are before you this morning challenging congresss 1998 sonny bono copyright term extension act which extended the term of subsisting and future copyrights by 20 years petitioners submit such a blanket extension of existing terms exceeds congresss power under the copyright clause and it violates the first amendment now the government has responded to petitioners argument in a way that betrays a simple but fundamental confusion the government has argued as if petitioners had advanced a general theory of the copyright clause or a general constraint under which congress must operate that is a mistake this case is about limits to an enumerated power its not about general power of congress to exercise its copyright authority petitioners have advanced a particular interpretation of the only express limits in the copyright clause designed to give those limits meaning mr lessig ill tell you what bothers me about your position and that is that congress has extended the term so often through the years and if you are right dont we run the risk of upsetting previous extensions of time i mean this seems to be a practice that began with the very first act justice we do not believe that the very first act extended terms at all speaking technically which for a lawyer means speaking accurately the 1790 act did not extend a federal term the 1790 act granted a term for works that already existed in precisely the pattern that the english parliament had done in the statute of anne in 1710 and that the english parliament did with monopolies general monopolies in the statute but there have been a number of extensions since thats right even if you can get over the first hurdle thats right thats the important hurdle and wed like to jump that first but the other ones justice youre right in 1831 and in 1909 congress extended terms in a way that is inconsistent with the strongest form of the test that we have advanced those extensions however were never challenged in any court and certainly not considered by this court well doesnt that itself mean something mr lessig the fact that they were never challenged perhaps most people and perhaps everybody felt there was no basis for challenging them well mr chief justice its absolutely true that this case is here because of a fundamentally important changed circumstance that makes the framers limitations on the copyright clause much more significant this is the first time i can remember where this court has been pointed to changed circumstances as a reason to reaffirm the framers values because for most of this period mr chief justice the only people who were regulated by copyright law under the copyright act would have been commercial publishers primarily and now for the first time the scope of this exclusive right has expanded because of the changed technology of the internet to reach an extraordinarily broad range of creativity that never would have been imagined before now its not the case that the earlier extensions were not questioned on constitutional grounds in fact melville nimmer in the consideration of the 1976 act suggested they were plainly under well im talking about court challenges not academic challenges thats right there is no court challenge mr lessig your theory as i understand it regardless of changed circumstances or not your basic theory which on your argument would have been appropriate at any time historically is that there has at least got to be the possibility of a kind of a causal connection between the extension and the promotion or inducement for the creation of some subsequent work but why is that any more plausible a reading of the promotion clause than simply a reading that says the promotion clause requires that there be a general scheme in place which overall tends to promote or induce and part of one aspect of that scheme can be that the that at the discretion of congress the period of protection is extended from time to time why do you require why do you say the clause has got to be read by this kind of specific causation theory as opposed to a kind of systemic theory of promotion justice souter the reason is exactly related to the point i began with that this is a case about limits and not about discretion if its not the case that this court no but thats i mean thats the issue in the alternative reading thats right and why is it a limit case rather than a discretion within a general scheme kind thats right of clause because if this court does not adopt a reading of the form weve offered then there is no limit to the ability of congress to extend subsisting terms do you say the same thing for scope this case is about duration but congress from time to time in fact you mentioned yes the expanded applications of copyright and congress itself extends the scope from time to time would you make as far as say translation rights that didnt exist before the same argument i why or and if you wouldnt why not i no justice ginsburg we would not and the reason is again related to the method we have adopted to interpret limited times we have not said that promote the progress of science is a general and independent constraint on the copyright clause authority weve said it must be looked to to interpret the scope of limited times and unless retrospective extensions are forbidden it will eviscerate the meaning of limited times that does not occur in the context of the scope of exclusive right nor in the context of the power to secure if thats could we then go back to justice oconnors question to make that very specific if we agree with you does that mean that we would in principle have to hold the 1976 extension unconstitutional i mean in 1976 congress extended the term from 28 years renewable once to life of the author plus 50 years now theyre extending it life of the author plus 70 if the latter is unconstitutional on your theory how could the former not be and if the former is the chaos that would ensue would be horrendous justice breyer under our theory as weve advanced it youre right the 1976 act would be unconstitutional whether this court would apply such a holding in this case to that act is a question that would have to be resolved under the retrospective maybe we ought to find another theory then is there any justice the theory which would advance the aim of limiting times in a way that is enforceable is only applicable in the case that we brought before you here to the 98 act and would not necessarily be applicable under the 76 act for the reasons the government has offered we would not advance this argument but the government has offered an argument in a parallel case that suggests a distinction between the 76 act and this case thats not been briefed here its been grounded in their claim that the treaty power creates some special power we wouldnt advance that claim but the point is there are a number of issues that the 76 act in essence you think its at least arguable that the 76 act had various positive aspects to it in terms of the purpose of the copyright clause that this act lacks thats certainly true and we also believe that for the reasons averted to by amicus aol in this case and the reasons youve just suggested the disruption in that context under the retrospectivity cases ryder and reynoldsville casket company would be sufficient to fit it within the quote severe disruption exception to the retrospectivity well i suppose implicit in the argument that the 76 act too should have been declared void and that we might leave it alone because of the disruption is that for all these years the act has impeded progress in science and the useful arts i just dont see any empirical evidence for that justice we are not making an empirical claim at all nothing in our copyright clause claim hangs upon the empirical assertion about impeding progress our only argument is this is a structural limit necessary to assure that what would be an effectively perpetual term not be permitted under the copyright laws well perhaps i misunderstood i thought the whole thrust of your is a great first amendment force silenced thats being thwarted well the thrust certainly i thought thats the whole underpinning of your case its certainly the case that we are asserting in light of the changed circumstances that the opportunity to build upon works within the public domain is a fundamental first amendment interest and that the first amendment values vital speech interest at stake of this case is that the public domain be permitted as a source for cultivating work about our culture without unnecessary legal restriction well but you want more than that you want the right to copy verbatim other peoples booksdont you we want the right to copy verbatim works that should be in the public domain and would be in the public domain but for a statute that cannot be justified under ordinary first amendment analysis or under a proper reading of the limits built into the copyright 16 clause mr lessig on your first amendment argument i dont see where the retroactivityprospectivity comes in because i follow your argument under the copyright clause but if youre saying that the time is too long the public domain should get this stuff sooner rather than later would you explain to me how your prospectivityretrospective line fits into your first amendment claim mr lessig justice weve argued that it would be inappropriate in this case for the court to consider the prospective line until they decide whether the case whether the prospective and retrospective is severable and we submit its an easy case to show that its not on the first amendment yes argument youre making that as i take it an argument independent of it doesnt hang on your copyright clause argument thats right i thats right and so lets just take lets say that was your only argument in this case how does that tie into a retrospectiveprospective distinction well the strongest first amendment argument is about the retrospective extension because of a fundamental change that occurs when congress extends subsisting copyrights rather than when congress legislates prospectively when congress legislates prospectively it has no way to know whos going to benefit from its extension it is simply evaluating what the term should be prospectively in a way that we presume this court should presume is legitimate under the first amendment when it legislates retrospectively it is in effect looking at particular authors and estates of authors who are before congress asking for this extension and its choosing between these particular authors and the public at large now it may be that in exercising that choice in this case congress made an objective valuation of who would be in the best position to advance the interests of promoting the progress of science or any original but you under your intermediate scrutiny test we would not be hypothesizing what might have been in congresss mind your first amendment test is a stringent one you have to have an important purpose and the means that you use is necessarily tied to that purpose if you take that position i dont see how you make the retroactiveprospective line work well the line comes from deciding what the first amendment interest is and if this court heed the first amendment interest off of this difference between selecting who gets the benefit of 20 years of extension and just simply legislating in a general way prospectively then this court could hold with respect to the prospective that its not even necessary to raise the intermediate scrutiny in that context but again for ashwander reasons we dont think that this court should address the prospective aspect of the ctea even under the first amendment even though congresss pattern has been to treat all authors equally i mean the reason that its been prospective and retrospective is that people should be people who hold copyrights should be subject to the same regime and not have some people who got their copyrights the week before the law passed treated differently than people who got it the week after well justice that certainly is the reason the government offers for this pattern it of course doesnt explain actually what congress has done and even in this case when a work has passed into the public domain then there is precisely the same week beforeweek after problem that you advert to that extension does not extend to all subsisting works it only extends to all subsisting copyrights so that line is already drawn in the practice that congress has adopted but our point is the only way to assure but congress has or youre not disputing that congress has always made these extensions both retroactive and prospective well in 1831 it did not in 1831 it granted the benefit of its extension to a subset of all subsisting copyright holders lets stick with 1976 in 1976 because that was what you said thats the pattern under the ctea is identical to the one in the 76 act thats absolutely right yes so they have extended it to both but our argument is unless this court draws a line about this extension then for the reasons judge sentelle suggested below there will be no limit to congresss ability to judge sentelle did not deal with the first amendment as far as i thats right recall thats right and so im asking you perhaps im missing it i havent seen where you get the prospectiveretrospective in connection with your first amendment it seems that youre just saying there that 70 years is an unreasonable is not necessary yes and it doesnt serve an important purpose preciselyactually were not saying anything about the 70 years in this case even under the first amendment because we believe its unseverable but but i thought you were saying that if you accept the copyright clause argument then you have a way in effect of devaluing the governments claim of its important interest and important objective when you get to the first amendment intermediate scrutiny analysis whereas if you dont accept the copyright clause claim then in order to make the first amendment analysis weve simply got to say well gee is the promotion of useful art and so on more important than the public domain and can we say that that allows a distinction between 50 years and 70 years were pretty much at sea so i thought your copyright clause argument was necessary to give us some handle with which to deal with the first amendment our copyright clause argument is certainly a way of framing why extensions of subsisting terms cannot be seen to promote the first amendment interest of speech at all okay lets assume we dont for the sake of argument here lets assume we dont accept the copyright clause argument do you have an independent first amendment argument in your brief yes of course we do okay and it is tell me in a sentence or two what it is i mean at that point im where justice ginsburg is yes the first amendment argument weve argued in our brief is with respect to the retrospective extension and the first amendment argument is that needs to no but thats the copyright clause argument and it seems to me youre saying okay we then apply that in first amendment analysis which allows us to make a coherent intermediate scrutiny argument if we dont accept the copyright clause retrospectivity argument yes then what is your first amendment argument thats right im sorry justice what im saying is not that its the retrospectivity that makes the first amendment argument troubling i mean that drives our first amendment argument all im saying is we have addressed the retrospective portion of ctea and so im saying in the retrospective portion of ctea you would apply ordinary intermediate first amendment review and you would ask well this court really has not if you say that the copyright clause is not violated i dont think there are examples where this court has then resorted to first amendment analysis to invalidate the same act well i mean this would be quite a new proposition well justice oconnor the first amendment is always an independent limitation on what otherwise would be legitimate exercises of congressional authority so this yes but the framers seem adopted these two things at the same time thats right in effect thats right and if and i think there are not to have examples that i can think of where we have said well well analyze it under the copyright clause but if that fails well turn to the first amendment justice thats right if only we had the framers copyright before us because of course again rememberthe exclusive right the framers spoke of was the right to print and publish it didnt include the derivative rights it didnt include the display rights and it certainly right it has expanded very much and they also envisioned a very short term and i can find a lot of fault with what congress did here thats right because it does take a lot of things out of the public domain that one would think that someone in congress would want to think hard about thats right but having done that its very difficult to find the basis in the constitution for saying it isnt a limited term its longer than one might think desirable right but is it not limited well if it is limited then there is no limit to the ability of congress to extend subsisting terms and that fundamentally destroys the objective that the the rule against perpetuities might jump in there at some point right and we submit the framers had something very different in mind than the rule against perpetuities the point is if this is permitted then there is no limit to the ability to extend terms and that is precisely contrary to what the framers had in mind when they worried about this problem originally what was the problem they were solving it was as this court stated in graham well i could agree with you in terms of policy that this flies directly in the face of what the framers had in mind absolutely but does it violate the constitution well if it flies in the face of what the framers had in mind then the question is is there a way of interpreting their words that gives effect to what they had in mind and the answer is yes well you know certainly what is happening in the country today in the way of congressional under the commerce clause is totally different than what the framers had in mind but weve never felt that that was the criterion what the framers thought of there werent steamboats there werent railroads thats right weve said there was a general grant and that congress was free to run with it in many respects in many respects mr chief justice but as this court has also said there are limits to what congress can do under the commerce clause but isnt can i ask you about one of the limits just focusing on the copyright clause and the progress of science and useful arts in your view does that is that limited to encouraging creativity by authors and inventors or does it also include the distribution of materials that might not otherwise be distributed like old films and so forth were happy to adopt a broader interpretation of what promote the progress is about within the general framework that the framers established in light of the english practice which was a quid pro quo the ability to facilitate distribution so that if the quid pro quo is that we can facilitate distribution of some old film by an additional monopoly grant youd think thats permissible so long as the grant is conditioned upon the distribution so long as the grant in other words you could have right now if congress decides to have a law and this law is going to give copyrights in 1 the bible 2 shakespeare 3 ben jonson and the reason they do it is that they think that that would lead publishers to produce those and distribute them and theyre right they will okay in your view thats perfectly constitutional no thats the view of the governments justice breyer my view is well i thought that was the question you were getting and i thought you were saying i must have misunderstood i thought you were saying that was constitutional no what we were saying is if congress wants to permit restoration of films for example an issue thats been well briefed here congress can say if you restore the film then the restoration gets a copyright so long as it satisfies originality as outlined in feist and it gets a copyright for a period of time but this courts opinion in graham and in feist made clear that it could not extend copyrights to works in the public domain the government doesnt concede that but we stand on that as a way of understanding why this court so your answer to justice stevens is no they cannot give a copyright purely for purposes of dissemination to publishers is that right no oh all right they cannot give a copyright purely for purposes of distribution to publishers they would need to satisfy all of the implied limitations that this court has expressed in the context of this the most carefully limited clause in article i section 8 it is one of the mr lessig the clause says congress shall and suppose congress decides in this expanded world of ours that its going to make certain changes and other changes from our treaty partners suppose it well the germans led the fight for 70 years in the european union well go with that but were going demand saysfair use now why couldnt that fit within the promotion of knowledge justice ginsburg we have no quarrel with the objective of harmonization fitting within the promote the progress of science understanding subject to constitutional limitations if france adopted a rule that said you couldnt grant copyrights to hate speech we could not harmonize with that rule consistent with our first amendment and similarly as mary beth peters testified before congress ours is the only constitution that has an express limitation on terms thats got to mean something and if it means that we are limited in our ability to agree with the europeans as they continually expand the term in light of their own vision of what copyright is about then thats the meaning of a constitutional restriction this courts interpretation of limited times could of course eviscerate that term of any meaning but under the principle of enumeration as this court has articulated it this court should interpret that clause in a way that gives its terms effect in a simple way just as a limited addition print is not a limited is not limited if each time a customer comes in a new print is printed so too a limited term is not limited if each time copyright holders come to congress they can extend the term thats right the analogy doesnt seem to work thats right all that im suggesting is here is a plain meaning of the term that gives effect to the constitutional limit in a way that assures that in fact the limit is respected contrary to the governments argument which in effect permits congress the power perpetually to extend terms if i may reserve the remainder of my time very well mr lessig general olson well hear from you oral argument of theodore b olson on behalf of the respondent mr chief justice and may it please the court the questions today especially the initial questions suggest one of the many insurmountable obstacles to petitioners petition in position in this case that is that the first congress explicitly gave copyright protection to the authors of any books already printed as well as explicitly the owners of existing copyrights thereafter in 1831 1909 1976 and 1998 and in numerous private copyright bills and temporary extensions of the copyright law and in repeated patent law revisions congress extended the terms of federal copyright and patent protection of subsisting works as this court explained 100 and some years ago in its burrowsgiles opinion such constructions are accorded very great weight and as that court went on to say when consistent and unchallenged for over a century are almost conclusive that consistent construction by congress of its authority under the copyright and patent clause now has lasted from the 105th from the first through the 105th congress it has been sustained by justices of this court and early decisions of this court it is consistent with what the law of england was from the statute of anne yes but take one of the early extensions just extending a an already granted patent to an inventor for an extra 10 years how can that be squared with the language of the provision maybe congress did it but maybe it acted improperly when it did it well the congress and thats our question really well that it seems to me that there may be this is the clause itself is a very very broad grant it says the do you view it as entirely a grant or do you think it also contains limitations well i think that to the extent that there may be limitations justice stevens they are require considerable deference by this court to the judgment of congress well i understand that but do you id be interested in knowing do you think it does contain limitations it contains the clause itself contains limitations limited times authors exclusive rights and things of that nature i dont think and the petitioners expressly disclaim the assertion that any substantive limitations in the promote the clause what the framers were saying is we want to give congress the authority to promote the progress of useful arts and sciences and how did the example we just talked about a patentee giving an extra 10 years on his how does that promote the progress of science well it may provide additional incentives for the patentee to exploit and promote and disseminate that particular work with respect to creative works like works of art books and that sort of thing it 20 patentee that there was a bargain in effect between the inventor and the government that at a certain period of time it would become part of the public domain it seems to me its inconsistent with that im just concentrating on our and im wondering how that fits into the notion it isnt inconsistent i submit justice stevens for the congress to exercise its juris its responsibility under this broad grant of power to determine that there could be many ways in which the holder of an existing right may benefit the public by continuing to have that right for an additional period of time the same reason that congress same reasons that congress had when it created the right in the first place its not just the right no the reason for the right in the first place was to encourage invention well but i we submit that specifically with respect to the copyright clause but i think it applies to the patent portion of the clause at all it isnt just the invention it isnt just the writing of the work and this relates to the questions that were asked of my colleague a moment ago it includes the dissemination of the work not necessarily dissemination alone not necessarily the dissemination alone well no not dont say not necessarily im for purposes of my thinking about it id like to know imagine we have just dissemination that something is already in the thats correct the only justification for the extension there is no other is dissemination of a work that is already in existence i would not want to rule that out justice breyer for the very reason well i want to say do you think yes or no well i think that it could very well be yes for the reason that in the 1790 statute the congress specifically was aware of that there were state copyright laws which didnt last as long as the federal statute several of the states hadnt finished enacting those copyright laws and a couple of states hadnt enacted them at all so in your opinion in my example if you recall it its your answer would be if congress tomorrow wants to give a copyright to a publisher solely for the purpose of reproducing and disseminating ben jonson shakespeare it can do it it may i hate to say may well because that really thats an important question well because i dont think that a per i dont think there is a per se rule that should apply here because this is a grant of congress to congress to exercise its judgment as to what may be beneficial there may be other constitutional provisions that come into play or there may be other existing all right let me explain to you why its important to me i have a list this is an economic statute the harms that seem to be caused by it the extension ive listed as follows approximate numbers made up but magnitude correct the existing copyright holders who survive their copyright survives 70 years who have already been paid on the numbers that were given about 24 billion or more will receive an extra 6 billion that i take it is a harm their works have already been created harm number 2 the fact that people for the 99 percent of the copyrights that have no commercial value after 70 years have to find the copyright holder to put them in databases the cost of that on my numbers in here made up at least a billion dollars or they cant find the people at all and get permission an innumerable cost un valuable cost to people who want to use it those are costs on the plus side i see uniformity dissemination and now you tell me well i also see compliance with international competitive markets and the laws that are being adopted and the incentives uniformity thats uniformity well thats not just uniformity its providing incentive to people to publish here as opposed to publish in europe where longer terms might be available there is an incentive to distribute existing works that may be necessary its the consistency that congress is promoting by saying to individuals as they might have said when they enacted the copyright clause in the first place we will not only give you 14 years but if we change our mind tomorrow and think that a better a longer period is necessary were this is consistency but its also a matter of fairness and its why on the last point its ive counted that as zero the reason ive counted it as zero is it seems to me that the added value incentive value to produce between life plus 50 or life plus 70 is zero its carried out as the economists do to three decimal points divide by 100 for the probability of your ever having such a work and you get virtually zero no difference between this and a perpetual copyright well i think that thats a very good illustration of why the authority is granted to congress because if you are an 80yearold writer that may make a considerable difference in terms of what you decide to do how could it it may because you may if you have no incentive if you know that go into the public domain sooner rather affect your judgment with respect to in i this is going to than later it may it might also publisher what the publisher pays for your prospective work justice breyer we the copyright clause incentive provides incentives not just for not just to the creators but to the disseminators the publishers the broadcasters the film companies so you think say verdi othello verdi othello 80 years old the prospect of an extra 20 years way down the pike would have made a difference well i think again that illustrates why the authority is vested in congress to make these judgments rather than in courts to make these affect whether the judgments because were not talking about the effect on an individual author or an individual creator what the framers of the constitution were concerned about is a gross judgment with respect to what might generally provide incentives to the population but it is hard to understand how if the overall purpose of the copyright clause is to encourage creative work how some retroactive extension could possibly do that i one wonders what was in the principle 13 difficult principle given to congress and has been exercised so repeatedly out there that would ever kick in well thats a that is a question to say whether there is any limiting when such a broad grant of power authority is that well if its a limited term as the constitution says is there indeed any limit out there what i submit well first of all even the petitioners acknowledge that as far as prospective limits are concerned that isnt a judgment that this court is being made to ask and in fact the petitioners acknowledge that it isnt a judgment that this court should make so the only point that the petitioners well if congress says were going to grant this copyright indefinitely forever that would seem that violates the limited term does it not i acknowledge that and anything that in victorian england you could buy a box seat for 900 years there was serene complacency about their culture and god bless them but i really think this is an important question and as justice oconnor points out if we have to ask whats the most plausible explanation for this rule to reward existing vested interest or to stimulate former new works it seems to me that its probably the former well i mean we know that it is well it let me say with respond in response to both of those questions an unlimited time would violate the copyright clause something that was the functional equivalent of an unlimited time would violate the copyright clause but the framers specifically did not put in numbers they had the opportunity to do that thomas jefferson suggested that a number should be put in we submit that it would be even since the petitioners dont suggest that its an appropriate function of this court certainly in this case to pick a number 133 years or something of that nature but it is quite clear that congress from the statute of anne 1710 we have 300 years of history of congress thinking that it continues to benefit the process not just of the productivity of the creation of the work itself but the dissemination of it to provide general olson you say that the functional equivalent of an unlimited time would be a violation but thats precisely the argument thats being made by petitioners here that a limited time which is extendable is the functionable functional equivalent of an unlimited time a limited time that 10 years from now can be extended and then extended again and extended again why their argument is precisely that a limited time doesnt mean anything unless it means once you have established the limit for works that have been created under that limit thats the end well the framers had an opportunity to say immutable unalterable unamendable they didnt use that they used the phrase limited term which means then meant then and means now a certain specified okay assuming number of years under the 5 statute with the exception of a limitation which illustrates the distinction between forever on the one hand and a definite number on the other is there any limitation in the clause does the promotion does the preambular recitation of promotion as such place a limit on it i submit justice souter that theres no per se limitation that if there is as justice scalia suggested for if it is true that congresshaving specified 14 years or 28 years decides that doesnt work very well because of the economies of other countries the parade of constraints on artists in other countries the reasons that we want things to be preserved or distributed it should be 2 more years or 5 more years later yes but that argument would apply to new copyrights but to extension of already existing copyrights your argument doesnt apply it does apply justice stevens because the work has already been created the work has already been created but the artists that are creating works day in and day out take into consideration the fact that congress has decided theres an ease of administration but for them they get the benefit of the longer term if you dont apply it to an existing copyright i mean if you say you need 70 years because of changes in the economy to encourage works you grant 70 for the future but why does that making that apply to somebody provided him were not just because were not just talking about the author if we were talking about the constitution refers to the authors and the inventors doesnt it theyre certainly the prime actors in this scene arent they yes but all of the history of the development of these clauses suggests that and this court has indicated in its decisions with respect to copyright that the framers were concerned and the congress is legitimately concerned not just in providing the spark of creativity but to make sure that thats distributed widely and available and there may be many reasons why were we and that it gets into the public the expiration of the term that was an part of the bargain yes and what but the definition of the term was a responsibility vested in congress because it has the power the legislative history of the 1998 act itself suggests what was going on here and suggests why the framers gave this authority to congress there were numerous hearings there were testimony by the folks that represent the same position as petitioners here as to why this shouldnt be done why it should be that this done congress weighed as this court the phrase court used i think it was in the feist casethe delicate balance that was so difficult for congress to how okay but you what weighs in that balance because to go back for one second in practical economic terms i gather the difference between a copyright that lasts for 100 years lasts for 1000 years lasts forever is probably something less than 1000 on 1000 a penny i mean its a penny on 1000 or probably a lot less than that frankly so i can not only not imagine a person whose decision to write would be governed by such a thing i cannot imagine a european who would come to america to copyright his work for such a reason indeed i wonder why that european wouldnt come anyway even if the term were 10 years because if he doesnt come hes not going to get protection well the i mean who are these people that are going to be moved by that incentive the as we described in our brief in pages 34 through 36 i believe it is in our brief that the concerns about the limitation on exploitation and the limitation of a copyright period in europe is based upon the country of origin of the work and the shortest time available so that there may be differences and we describe that but that illustrates justice breyer the difference between 1 cents and 10 cents and 100 with respect to this particular author whos this particular age or a particular author like melville whose works werent werent didnt or schubert whose works werent properly appreciated or exploitable until many years after their death all of these variations are quintessentially legislative judgments it would be very difficult for the framers to have eschewed deciding 14 years was a constitutional limitation and for this court to say 99 years is and again even the petitioners arent asking the court to make that judgment the petitioners are only saying that there shall be a per se rule that the word limited times means unchangeable times but there has to be a limit as you acknowledge perpetual copyright is not permitted who is the judge of within that line who is the judge of when it becomes unlimited is there in other words judicial review and if there is what standard would this court apply to determine whether something short of perpetual is still unlimited well the issue before this court i hasten to say as i said before is only whether once the congress makes that judgment it can ever change it retrospectively the issue before this court is not whether in the future a certain length of time would be appropriate that but the answer to that justice ginsburg i submit is found in the necessary and proper clause and this courts interpretation of the necessary and proper clause as to the extent that this court would find or not find that the judgment made by congress with respect to the implementation of this very broad power is convenient or useful in terms of the achievement of the 2 goals okay and is your argument that we find and hold against their retrospective because there is some at least plausible basis should so argument to say that there can be a causal connection between the retrospective extension and some benefit that can be traced to those particular works through the retrospective extension like dissemination is that your argument that is among our arguments justice souter is it also your argument that even if you cannot trace that kind or at least plausibly argue that there could be that kind of a causal benefit that it would still be constitutional because you should judge the extension simply as contributing to a general system one feature of which is that from time to time there may be retrospective extensions and so long as that general system induces the creation of works or the dissemination of works or the preservation of works so long as the general system works there is no review no limitation on the tinkering that can be done even retrospectively is that also your argument i think thats a fair statement of an argument that we have made and articulated in the brief okay that unless there is a the court is because the circumstances change that we are living in an era now where piracy is a significant problem theres question of administrative ease of administering a system where copyrights may be different for one set of authors or different for another set of authors theres changes that are taking place internationally so that what were saying is that not only could this court conceive of reasons why congress thought it was accomplishing the objectives of this clause but that there are numerous objectives that are entirely legitimate in do you also argue that the necessary and proper clause alone will justify the retroactive extension simply as a matter of equity yes that is that the copyright clause justifies the extension for works not yet created but it would be enormously inequitable to have other authors who put in the same amount of work get a lesser protection so the necessary and proper clause now allows you to do the 24 retrospective yes justice scalia and the examples that are can i ask you why is it enormously inequitable if they get exactly what they were entitled to at the time they made the work the implicit promise that i mean they have some right to expect that they will be you know an additional grant later on i think thats not an unreasonable expectation at all justice stevens because that was the premise of the that is the way its always been done there hasnt been any copyright extension that hasnt applied to subsisting work thats but there was one justice breyer brought up ben jonson so this case doesnt involve works that are already in the public domain that is correct this is subsisting copyrights that is correct so but why wouldnt it why why not why wouldnt it if the equity argument under the necessary and proper clause justifies extension of the copyright for those whose copyright will expire tomorrow if its not extended in order to put them on parity with those getting copyrights for new works why doesnt it apply to the copyright the holder of the copyright that expired yesterday you could arguably you could conceivably make that argument justice souter but there is a bright line there something that has already gone into the public domain which other individuals or companies or entities may then have acquired an interest in or rights to or be involved in disseminating and if you dont this is a rational if you dont draw the line there then ben jonson certainly gets recopyrighted well the difficulty if were just looking for a bright line the line that they suggest between unexpired patents and copyrights and brand new ones is also just as bright oh i concede that its a bright line but its a bright line that would have except congress chose this one and didnt choose the other one thats congress basically youre saying the presumption ought to be in the congressional judgment about how to draw the line as well as in how long a line to draw i agree and this court has were not just talking about the judgment of the congress of the the 105th congress in 1998 this is the way the statute of anne was written this is the way the state copyright laws were written when this country became a nation this is the way the 1790 copyright statute the number of well of course the original statute was replacing a bunch of state statutes or state rules partly common law partly statutory that they had kind of a mixed up legal situation and there was an interest in having one uniform rule for the first time around well there was an interest in having a uniform rule and thats precisely why the framers created the copyright clause in the constitution but there was copyright protection in some states there wasnt copyright protection in other states and what we know from the decision of this court in the wheaton decision is that there was not a common law copyright in existence this court explicitly held that now the petitioners make this quid pro quo to draw the line as well as in how long a line i agree and this court has just talking about the judgment of the congress the 105th congress in 1998 this is the way the argument that somehow implicitly the initial 1790 copyright statute was saying to people you get a copyright if you exchange whatever existing rights you have that simply does not make any sense there is no language and its a relatively latediscovered argument because it sees its full i want you to finish that but i want you to go back to the i have one question on the equity principle are you i want you to finish i wasnt finished but im happy to come back go ahead no no you finish well i was going to say no language whatsoever of preemption abandonment abrogation or exchange in the 1790 copyright but compare copyright act but compare that to thefirst theres patent act under the same clause where there is that exchange there the other thing as this court has said there is no implied abrogation of common law rights which would be a doctrine which would be inconsistent with what the petitioner is arguing now why i mean i think you have a point on this equity principle i wonder is there any review there that is suppose you have a statute as this one arguably is where 999 percent many billions of dollars of benefits are going to the existing holders of copyright on grounds of equity and the effect of the statute in eliciting new works is near zero i mean that would seem where this equity idea is the camel and the production idea is the gnat and is there any can we say something like that or does congress have total leeway in respect to well it who they want to give the money to basically justice breyer its conceivable that the court might do that if that situation was present but its not remotely the situation here we have the adoption of copyright terms which are consistent generally speaking with copyright terms which exist in the european union our principal competitor and in connection with international treaties we have a copyright term thats consistent with the concept of the creator plus the creators first generation heirs we have a copyright term remember which supersedes the earlier copyright provisions that were added to the period between creation and publication so that the limited number of years in the first the 1790 and the 1831 statute were the number of years plus the relatively unlimited period of time between creation and publication so we dont have anything remotely like that in this situation we have a process which as you suggested or one of the questions suggested is may not have been the policy that you as a member of congress would have supported you might have made the balance that delicate balance that this court has referred to in another way but that is something that congress through its ability to gather facts and make balances is quintessentially capable of doing and that is where the framers vested the responsibility and what this statute does is to favor if at all the creator with respect to the utilization of these rights as opposed to the person who wishes to copy the creator thats an entirely rational distinction for congress to make thank you thank you general olson mr lessig you have 3 minutes remaining rebuttal argument of lawrence lessig on behalf of the petitioners general olson has been perfectly clear in setting out the structure of the governments argument it is that there is no effective limit on congresss power under the copyright clause now were this the first time this court had considered congresss copyright authority that might be a plausible argument but the very first time this court ever struck down a law of congress as exceeding article i section 8 power was in the context of the copyright clause we have 125 years of history of this court making sure that the limits both express and implied in the copyright clause have some meaning the feist opinion very clearly sets out the implied limits a per se limit for originality for the reasons justice breyer was trying to get me to say the harper as well as graham set out very clear limits on the context of the ability to extend works in the public domain those limits make no sense under the reasoning the government has offered the governments reasoning would make all of those opinions irrelevant and wrong now we offer a simple way to make this clear express limit make sense and that is precisely the understanding we suggest that existed in 1790 the only precedents that existed in 1790 were precedents of setting a term and then when parliament was asked in 1735 37 and 39 to extend it they rejected it and as amicus historians said they rejected it because as a pamphleteer described it that would be effectively a perpetual term now this delicate balance that the government invokes justice breyer let me give you the numbers the delicate balance is that under the most reasonable assumptions of copyright royalty income and under our interest rate of 7 percent as the amicus economists note at page 6 note 6 of their brief the current term gives authors 998 percent of the value of a perpetual term now that might be a delicate balance that they give the author 998 percent and the public 2 percent but in my mind thats delicate in a very different sense of that term thank you very much thank you mr lessig the case is submitted whereupon at 1101 am the case in the aboveentitled matter was submitted 
 debate transcript october 11 2000 the second gorebush presidential debate lets welcome the candidates governor bush and vice president gore good evening from wake chapel at wake forest university at winstonsalem north carolina im jim lehrer of the news hour on pbs welcome to this second election 2000 debate between the republican candidate for president george w bush of texas and the democratic candidate vice president al gore these debates are sponsored by the commission on presidential debates the format and the rules are those negotiated by representatives of the two campaigns only the subjects tonight and the questions are mine the format tonight is that of a conversation the only prevailing rule is that no single response can ever ever exceed two minutes the prevailing rule for the audience here in the hall is as always absolute quiet please good evening governor bush vice president gore the end of our 90 minutes last week in boston the total time each of you took was virtually the same lets see if we can do the same tonight or come close governor bush the first question goes to you one of you is about to be elected the leader of the singlemost powerful nation in the world economically financially militarily diplomatically you name it have you formed any guiding principles for exercising this enormous power i have i have first question is whats in the best interests of the united states whats in the best interests of our people when it comes to foreign policy that will be my guiding question is it in our nations interests peace in the middle east is in our nations interests having a hemisphere that is free for trade and peaceful is in our nations interests strong relations in europe is in our nations interest ive thought a lot about what it means to be the president i also understand that an administration is not one person but an administration is dedicated citizens who are called by the president to serve the country to serve a cause greater than self and so ive thought about an administration of people who represent all america but people who understand my compassionate and conservative philosophy i havent started naming names except for one person and thats mr richard cheney who i thought did a great job the other night hes a vice presidential nominee who represents i think people got to see why i picked him hes man of solid judgment and hes going to be a person to stand by my side one of the things ive done in texas is ive been able to put together a good team of people ive been able to set clear goals the goals ought to be an education system that leaves no child behind medicare for our seniors a social security system thats safe and secure foreign policy thats in our nations interest and a strong military and then bring people together to achieve those goals thats what a chief executive officer does so ive thought long and hard about the honor of being the president of the united states vice president gore yes jim ive thought a lot about that particular question and i see our greatest national strength coming from what we stand for in the world i see it as a question of values it is a great tribute to our founders that 224 years later this nation is now looked to by the peoples on every other continent and the peoples from every part of this earth as a kind of model for what their future could be and i dont think thats just the kind of exaggeration that we take pride in as americans its really true even the ones that sometimes shake their fists at us as soon as they have a change that allows the people to speak freely theyre wanting to develop some kind of blueprint that will help them be like us more freedom free markets political freedom so i think first and foremost our power ought to be wielded to in ways that form a more perfect union the power of example is americas greatest power in the world and that means for example standing up for human rights it means addressing the problems of injustice and inequity along the lines of race and ethnicity here at home because in all these other places around the world where theyre having these terrible problems when they feel hope it is often because they see in us a reflection of their potential so weve got to enforce our civil rights laws weve got to deal with things like racial profiling and we have to keep our military strong we have the strongest military and ill do whatever is necessary if im president to make sure that it stays that way but our real power comes i think from our values should the people of the world look at the united states governor and say should they fear us should they welcome our involvement should they see us as a friend everybody in the world how would you project us around the world as president well i think they ought to look at us as a country that understands freedom where it doesnt matter who you are or how youre raised or where youre from that you can succeed i dont think theyll look at us with envy it really depends upon how our nation conducts itself in foreign policy if were an arrogant nation theyll resent us if were a humble nation but strong theyll welcome us and its our nation stands alone right now in the world in terms of power and thats why we have to be humble and yet project strength in a way that promotes freedom so i dont think they ought to look at us in any way other than what we are were a freedomloving nation and if were an arrogant nation theyll view us that way but if were a humble nation theyll respect us a humble nation i agree with that i agree with that i think that one of the problems that we have faced in the world is that we are so much more powerful than any single nation has been in relationship to the rest of the world than at any time in history that i know about anyway that there is some resentment of us power so i think that the idea of humility is an important one but i think that we also have to have a sense of mission in the world we have to protect our capacity to push forward what americas all about that means not only military strength and our values it also means keeping our economy strong you know in the last or two decades ago it was routine for leaders of foreign countries to come over here and say you guys have got to do something about these horrendous deficits because its causing tremendous problems for the rest of the world and we were lectured to all the time the fact that we have the strongest economy in history today is not good enough we need to do more but the fact that it is so strong enables us to project the power for good that america can represent does that give us does our wealth our good economy our power bring with it special obligations to the rest of the world yes it does take for example third world debt i think we ought to be forgiving third world debt under certain conditions i think for example if were convinced that a third world country thats got a lot of debt would reform itself that the money wouldnt go into the hands of a few but would go to help people i think it makes sense for us to use our wealth in that way or to trade debt for valuable rain forest lands makes that much sense yes we do have an obligation but we cant be all things to all people we can help build coalitions but we cant put our troops all around the world we can lend money but we have to do it wisely we shouldnt be lending money to corrupt officials so we have to be guarded in our generosity lets go through some of the specifics now new question vice president gore the governor mentioned the middle east here were talking at this stage in the game about diplomatic power that we have what do you think the united states should do right now to resolve that conflict over there the first priority has to be on ending the violence dampening down the tensions that have arisen there we need to call upon syria to release the three israeli soldiers who have been captured we need to insist that arafat send out instructions to halt some of the provocative acts of violence that have been going on i think that we also have to keep a weather eye toward saddam hussein because he is taking advantage of this situation to once again make threats and he needs to understand that hes not only dealing with israel he is dealing hes dealing with us if he is making the kind of threats that hes talking about there the use of diplomacy in this situation has already well it goes hourbyhour and daybyday now its a very tense situation there but in the last 24 hours there has been some subsiding of the violence there its too much to hope that this is going to continue but i do hope that it will continue our country has been very active with regular conversations with the leaders there and we just have to take it daytoday right now but one thing i would say where diplomacy is concerned israel should feel absolutely secure about one thing our bonds with israel are larger than agreements or disagreements on some details of diplomatic initiatives they are historic they are strong and they are enduring and our ability to serve as an honest broker is something that we need to shepherd governor well i think during the campaign particularly now during this difficult period we ought to be speaking with one voice and i appreciate the way the administration has worked hard to calm the tensions like the vice president i call on chairman arafat to have his people pull back to make the peace i think credibility is going to be very important in the future in the middle east i want everybody to know should i be the president israels going to be our friend im going to stand by israel secondly that i think its important to reach out to moderate arab nations like jordan and egypt saudi arabia and kuwait its important to be friends with people when you dont need each other so that when you do theres a strong bond of friendship and thats going to be particularly important in dealing not only with situations such as now occurring in israel but with saddam hussein the coalition against saddam has fallen apart or its unraveling lets put it that way the sanctions are being violated we dont know whether hes developing weapons of mass destruction he better not be or theres going to be a consequence should i be the president but its important to have credibility and credibility is formed by being strong with your friends and resoluting your determination one of the reasons why i think its important for this nation to develop an antiballistic missile system that we can share with our allies in the middle east if need be to keep the peace is to be able to say to the saddam husseins of the world or the iranians dont dare threaten our friends its also important to keep strong ties in the middle east credible ties because of the energy crisis were now in after all a lot of the energy is produced from the middle east and so i appreciate what the administration is doing i hope to get a sense of should i be fortunate to be the president how my administration will react to the middle east so you dont believe vice president gore that we should take sides and resolve this right now a lot of people pushing hey the united states should declare itself and not be so neutral in this particular situation well we stand with israel but we have maintained the ability to serve as an honest broker and one of the reasons thats important is that israel cannot have direct dialogue with some of the people on the other side of conflicts especially during times of tension unless that dialogue comes through us and if we throw away that ability to serve as an honest broker then we have thrown we will have thrown away a strategic asset thats important not only to us but also to israel you agree with that governor i do i do think this though when it comes to timetables it cant be the united states timetable as to how discussions take place its got to be a timetable that all parties can agree to like the palestinians and israelis secondly any lasting peace is going to have to be a peace thats good for both sides and therefore the term honest broker makes sense this current administrations worked hard to keep the parties at the table i will try to do the same thing but it wont be on my timetable it will be on the timetable that people are comfortable with in the middle east people watching here tonight are very interested in middle east policy and they are so interested they want to base their vote on differences between the two of you as president how you would handle middle east policy is there any difference i havent heard a big difference in the last few exchanges thats hard to tell i think that you know i would hope to be able to convince people i could handle the iraqi situation better saddam hussein you mean get him out of there i would like to of course and i presume this administration would as well we dont know there are no inspectors now in iraq the coalition that was in place isnt as strong as it used to be he is a danger we dont want him fishing in troubled waters in the middle east and its going to be hard its going to be important to rebuild that coalition to keep the pressure on him you feel that is a failure of the clinton administration i do well when i got to be a part of the current administration it was right after i was one of the few members of my political party to support former president bush in the persian gulf war resolution and at the end of that war for whatever reason it was not finished in a way that removed saddam hussein from power i know there are all kinds of circumstances and explanations but the fact is that thats the situation that was left when i got there and we have maintained the sanctions now i want to go further i want to give robust support to the groups that are trying to overthrow saddam hussein and i know there are allegations that theyre too weak to do it but thats what they said about the forces that were opposing milosevic in serbia and you know the policy of enforcing sanctions against serbia has just resulted in a spectacular victory for democracy just in the past week and it seems to me that having taken so long to see the sanctions work there building upon the policy of containment that was successful over a much longer period of time against the former soviet union in the communist block seems a little early to declare that we should give up on the sanctions i know the governors not necessarily saying that but you know all of these flights that have come in all of them have been in accordance with the sanctions regime im told except for three where they notified and theyre trying to break out of the box theres no question about it i dont think they should be allowed to did he state your position correctly youre not calling for eliminating the sanctions are you no of course not absolutely not i want them to be tougher lets go on to milosevic and yugoslavia and it falls under the area of our military power governor new question should the fall of milosevic be seen as a triumph for us military intervention i think its a triumph i thought the president made the right decision in joining nato and bombing serbia i supported them when they did so i called upon the congress not to hamstring the administration and in terms of forcing troop withdrawals on a timetable that wasnt necessarily in our best interest or fit our nations strategy and so i think its good public policy i think it worked and im pleased i took made the decision i made im pleased the president made the decision he made because freedom to go in that part of the world and where theres a lot of work left to be done however but you think it would not have happened do you think that milosevic would not have fallen if the united states and nato had not intervened militarily is this a legitimate use of our military power yes i think it is absolutely i dont think he would have fallen had we not used the force and i know there are some in our party that disagree with that sentiment i supported the president i thought he made the right decision to do so i didnt think he necessarily made the right decision to take land troops off the table right before we committed ourselves offensively but nevertheless it worked the administration deserves credit for having made it work it is important for nato to have it work its important for nato to be strong and confident and to help keep the peace in europe and one of the reasons i felt so strongly that the united states needed to participate was because of our relations with nato and nato is going to be an important part of keeping the peace in the future now theres more work to do remains to be seen however whether or not theres going to be a political settlement in kosovo and i certainly hope there is one also on record as saying at some point in time i hope our european friends become the peacekeepers in bosnia and in the balkans i hope that they put the troops on the ground so that we can withdraw our troops and focus our military on fighting and winning war well ive been kind of a hardliner on this issue for more than eight years when i was in the senate before i became vice president i was pushing for stronger action against milosevic he caused the death of so many people he was the last communist party boss there and then he became a dictator that by some other label he was still essentially a communist dictator and unfortunately now he is trying to reassert himself in serbian politics already just today the members of his political party said that they were going to ignore the orders of the new president of serbia and that they question his legitimacy and hes still going to try to be actively involved he is an indicted war criminal he should be held accountable now i did want to pick up on one of the statements earlier and maybe i have heard maybe i have heard the previous statements wrong governor in some of the discussions weve had about when its appropriate for the us to use force around the world at times the standards that youve laid down have given me the impression that if its something like a genocide taking place or what they called ethnic cleansing in bosnia that that alone would not be that that wouldnt be the kind of situation that would cause you to think that the us ought to get involved with troops now have to be other factors involved for me to want to be involved but by itself that to me can bring into play a fundamental american strategic interest because i think its based on our values now have i got that wrong trying to figure out who the questioner was if i think its in our nations strategic interest ill commit troops i thought it was in our strategic interests to keep milosevic in check because of our relations in nato and thats why i took the position i took i think its important for nato to be strong and confident i felt like unchecked milosevic would harm nato and so it depends on the situation mr vice president well lets stay on the subject for a moment new question related to this i figured this out in the last 20 years there have been eight major actions that involved the introduction of us ground air or naval forces let me name them lebanon grenada panama the persian gulf somalia bosnia haiti kosovo if you had been president for any of those interventions would any of those interventions not have happened can you run through the list again sure lebanon i thought that was a mistake grenada i supported that panama i supported that persian gulf yes i voted for it supported it somalia of course and that again no i think that that was illconsidered i did support it at the time it was in the previous administration in the bushquayle administration and i think in retrospect the lessons there are ones that we should take very very seriously bosnia oh yes haiti yes and then kosovo yes we talked about that want me to do it with you lebanon make a couple comments sure absolutely sure somalia started off as a humanitarian mission and it changed into a nationbuilding mission and thats where the mission went wrong the mission was changed and as a result our nation paid a price and so i dont think our troops ought to be used for whats called nationbuilding i think our troops ought to be used to fight and win war i think our troops ought to be used to help overthrow the dictator when its in our best interests but in this case it was a nationbuilding exercise and same with haiti i wouldnt have supported either what about lebanon yes grenada yes panama yes some of them ive got a conflict of interest on if you know what i mean i do i do the persian gulf obviously and bosnia and you have already talked about kosovo but the reverse side of the question governor that vice president gore mentioned 600000 people died in rwanda in 1994 there was no us intervention no intervention from the outside world was that a mistake not to intervene i think the administration did the right thing in that case i do it was a horrible situation no one liked to see it on our tv screens but its a case where we need to make sure we have an early warning system in place in places where there could be ethnic cleansing and genocide the way we saw it there in rwanda and thats a case where we need to use our influence to have countries in africa come together and help deal with the situation the administration seem like were having a great love for us tonight but the administration made the right decision on training nigerian troops for situations just such as this in rwanda and so i thought they made the right decision not to send us troops into rwanda do you have any second thoughts on that based on what you said a moment ago about genocide id like to come back to the question of nation building but let me address the question directly first fine we did actually send troops into rwanda to help with the humanitarian relief measures my wife tipper who is here actually went on a military plane with general sholicatchvieli on one of those flights but i think in retrospect we were too late getting in there we could have saved more lives if we had acted earlier but i do not think that it was an example of a conflict where we should have put our troops in to try to separate the parties for this reason jim one of the criteria that i think is important in deciding when and if we should ever get involved around the world is whether or not our national security interest is involved if we can really make the difference with military forces we tried everything else if we have allies in the balkans we have allies nato ready willing and able to go and carry a big part of the burden in africa we did not now we have tried our countries tried to create an africa crisis response team there and weve met some resistance we have had some luck with nigeria but in sierra leon and now that nigeria has become a democracy and we hope it stays that way then maybe we can build on that but because we had no allies and because it was very unclear that we could actually accomplish what we would want to accomplish about putting military forces there i think it was the right thing not to jump in as heartbreaking as it was but i think we should have come in much quicker with the humanitarian mission so what would you say governor that somebody would say hey wait a minute why not africa i mean why the middle east why the balkans but not africa when 600000 peoples lives are at risk well i understand and africa is important and weve got to do a lot of work in africa to promote democracy and trade and there are some vice president mentioned nigeria is a fledgling democracy we have to work with nigeria thats an important continent but theres got to be priorities and middle east is a priority for a lot of reasons as is europe and the far east our own hemisphere and those are my four top priorities should i be the president not to say we wont be engaged nor work hard to get other nations to come together to prevent atrocity i thought the best example of a way to handle the situation was east timor when we provided logistical support to the australians support that only we can provide i thought that was a good model but we cant be all things to all people in the world jim and i think thats where maybe the vice president and i begin to have some differences im worried about overcommitting our military around the world i want to be judicious in its use you mentioned haiti i wouldnt have sent troops to haiti i didnt think it was a mission worthwhile it was a nation building mission and it was not very successful it cost us billions a couple billions of dollars and im not so sure democracy is any better off in haiti than it was before vice president gore do you agree with the governors views on nation building the use of military our military for nation building as he described and defined it i dont think we agree on that i would certainly also be judicious in evaluating any potential use of american troops overseas i think we have to be very reticent about that but look jim the world is changing so rapidly the way i see it the world is getting much closer together like it or not we are now the united states is now the natural leader of the world all these other countries are looking to us now just because we cannot be involved everywhere and shouldnt be doesnt mean that we should shy away from going in anywhere now both of us are kind of i guess stating the others position in a maximalist extreme way but i think there is a difference here this idea of nation building is kind of a pejorative phrase but think about the great conflict of the past century world war ii during the years between world war i and world war ii a great lesson was learned by our military leaders and the people of the united states the lesson was that in the aftermath of world war i we kind of turned our backs and left them to their own devices and they brewed up a lot of trouble that quickly became world war ii and acting upon that lesson in the aftermath of our great victory in world war ii we laid down the marshall plan president truman did we got intimately involved in building nato and other structures there we still have lots of troops in europe and what did we do in the late 40s and 50s and 60s we were nation building and it was economic but it was also military and the confidence that those countries recovering from the wounds of war had by having troops there we had civil administrators come in to set up their ways of building their towns back you said in the boston debate governor on this issue of nation building that the united states military is overextended now where is it overextended where are there us military that you would bring home if you become president first let me just say one comment about what the vice president said i think one of the lessons in between world war i and world war ii is we let our military atrophy and we cant do that weve got to rebuild our military but one of the problems we have in the military is were in a lot of places around the world and i mentioned one and thats the balkans i would very much like to get our troops out of there i recognize we cant do it now nor do i advocate an immediate withdrawal that would be an abrogation of our agreement with nato no one is suggesting that but i think it ought to be one of our priorities to work with our european friends to convince them to put troops on the ground and there is an example haiti is another example now there are some places where i think you know ive supported the administration in columbia i think its important for us to be training columbians in that part of the world the hemisphere is in our interest to have a peaceful columbia but the use of the military there some people are now suggesting that if you dont want to use the military to maintain the peace to do the civil thing is it time to consider a civil force of some kind that comes in after the military that builds nations or all of that is that on your radar screen i dont think so i think what we need to do is convince people who live in the lands they live in to build the nations maybe im missing something here i mean were going to have kind of a nation building core from america absolutely not our military is meant to fight and win war thats what its meant to do and when it gets overextended morale drops i strongly believe we need to have a military presence in the peninsula not only to keep the peace in the peninsula but to keep regional stability and i strongly believe we need to keep a presence in nato but im going to be judicious as to how to use the military it needs to be in our vital interest the mission needs to be clear and the extra strategy obvious i dont disagree with that i certainly dont disagree that we ought to get our troops home from places like the balkans as soon as we can as soon as the mission is complete thats what we did in haiti there are no more than a handful of american military personnel in haiti now and haitians have their problems but we gave them a chance to restore democracy thats really about all we can do but if you have a situation like that right in our backyard with chaos about to break out and flotillas forming to come across the water and all kinds of violence there right in one of our neighboring countries there then i think that we did the right thing there and as for this idea of nation building the phrase sounds grandiose and you know we cant be we cant allow ourselves to get overextended i certainly agree with that and thats why ive supported building up our capacity ive devoted in the budget ive proposed as i said last week more than twice as much as the governor has proposed i think that its in better shape now than he generally does weve had some disagreements about that he said that two divisions would have to report not ready for duty and thats not what the joint chiefs say but theres no doubt that we have to continue building up readiness and military strength and we have to also be very cautious in the way we use our military in the nonmilitary area of influencing events around the world the financial and economic are the world bank president wilfinson said recently governor that us contributions to overseas development assistance is lower now almost than it has ever been is that a problem for you do you think what is your what is your idea about what the united states obligations are im talking about financial assistance and that sort of thing to other countries the poor countries well i mentioned third world debt sure thats a place where we can use our generosity to influence in a positive way influence nations i believe we ought to have foreign aid but i dont think we ought to just have foreign aid for the sake of foreign aid i think foreign aid needs to be used to encourage markets and reform i think a lot of times we just spend aid and say we feel better about it and it ends up being spent the wrong way and theres some pretty egregious examples recently one being russia where we had imf loans that ended up in the pockets of a lot of powerful people and didnt help the nation i think the imf has got a role in the world but i dont want to see the imf out there as a way to say to world bankers if you make a bad loan well bail you out it needs to be available for emergency situations i thought the president did the right thing with mexico and was very strongly supportive of the administration in mexico but i dont think the imf ought to be a stop loss for people who ought to be able to evaluate risks themselves so ill look at every place where were investing money i just want to make sure the return is good do you think were meeting our obligations properly no i would make some changes i think there need to be reforms in the imf ive generally supported it but ive seen them make some calls that i thought were highly questionable and i think that theres a general agreement in many parts of the world now that there ought to be changes in the imf the world bank i think is generally doing a better job but i think one of the big issues here that doesnt get nearly enough attention is the issue of corruption the governor mentioned it earlier ive worked on this issue its an enormous problem and corruption in official agencies like militaries and police departments around the world customs officials thats one of the worst forms of it and we have got to again lead by example and help these other countries that are trying to straighten out their situations find the tools in order to do it i just think jim that this is an absolutely unique period in world history the world has come together as i said theyre looking to us and we have a fundamental choice to make are we going to step up to the plate as a nation the way we did after world war ii the way that generation of heroes said okay the united states is going to be the leader and the world benefitted tremendously from the courage that they showed in those postwar years i think that in the aftermath of the cold war its time for us to do something very similar to step up to the plate to provide the leadership on the environment leadership to make sure the world economy keeps moving in the right direction again that means not running big deficits here and not squandering our surplus it means having intelligent decisions that keep our prosperity going and shepherds that economic strength so that we can provide that leadership role let me comment on that im not so sure the role of the united states is to go around the world and say this is the way its got to be we can help and maybe its just our difference in government the way we view government i want to empower the people i want to help people help themselves not have government tell people what to do i just dont think its the role of the united states to walk into a country and say we do it this way so should you i think we can help i know weve got to encourage democracy in the marketplaces but take russia for example we went into russia we said here is some imf money and it ended up in viktor chemomyrdins pocket and others and yet we played like there was reform the only people that are going to reform russia are russia theyre going to have to make the decision themselves mr putin is going to have to make the decision as to whether or not he wants to adhere to rule of law and normal accounting practices so that if countries andor entities invest capital theres a reasonable rate of return a way to get the money out of the economy but russia has to make the decision we can work with them on security matters for example but its their call to make so im not exactly sure where the vice president is coming from but i think one way for us to end up being viewed as the ugly american is for us to go around the world saying we do it this way so should you now we trust freedom we know freedom is a powerful powerful powerful force much bigger than the united states of america as we saw recently in the balkans but maybe i misunderstand where youre coming from mr vice president but i think the united states must be humble and must be proud and confident of our values but humble in how we treat nations that are figuring out how to chart their own course lets move on no lets move on far be it from me to suggest otherwise first a couple of followups from the vice presidential debate last week vice president gore would you support or sign as president a federal law banning racial profiling by police and other authorities at all levels of government yes i would the only thing an executive order can accomplish is to ban it in federal law enforcement agencies but i would also support a law in the congress that would have the effect of doing the same thing i just i think that racial profiling is a serious problem i remember when the stories first came out about the stops in new jersey by the highway patrol there and i know its been going on a long time in some ways this is just a new label for something that has been going on for years but i have to confess that it was the first time that i really focused on it in a new way and i was surprised at the extent of it and i think weve now got so many examples around the country that we really have to find ways to end this imagine what it what it is like for someone to be singled out unfairly unjustly and feel the unfair force of law simply because of race or ethnicity now that runs counter to what the united states of america is all about at our core and its not an easy problem to solve but if i am entrusted with the presidency it will be the first civil rights act of the 21st century yeah i cant imagine what it would be like to be singled out because of race and stopped and harassed thats just flat wrong and thats not what america is all about and so we ought to do everything we can to end racial profiling one of my concerns though is i dont want to federalize the local police forces i want to obviously in the egregious cases we need to enforce civil rights law but we need to make sure that internal affairs decisions at the local level do their job and be given a chance to do their job i believe in local control of governments and obviously if they dont there needs to be a consequence at the federal level but its very important that we not overstep our bounds and i think most people most police officers are good dedicated honorable citizens who are doing their job putting their lives at risk who arent bigoted or arent prejudiced i dont think they ought to be held guilty but i do think we need to find out where racial profiling occurs and do something about it and say to the local folks get it done and if you cant there will be a federal consequence and that could be a federal law yeah and you would agree i would agree and i also agree that most police officers of course are doing a good job and hate this practice also i talked to an africanamerican police officer in springfield massachusetts not long ago who raised this question and said that in his opinion one of the biggest solutions is in the training and not only the training in police procedures but human relations and i think that racial profiling is part of a larger issue of how we deal with race in america and as for singling people out because of race you know james byrd was singled out because of his race in texas and other americans have been singled out because of their race or ethnicity and thats why i think we can embody our values by passing a hate crimes law i think these crimes are different i think theyre different because theyre based on prejudice and hatred which gives rise to crimes that have not just a single victim but theyre intended to stigmatize and dehumanize a whole group of people you have a different view of that no i dont really on hate crimes laws no weve got one in texas and guess what the three men who murdered james byrd guess whats going to happen to them theyre going to be put to death a jury found them guilty its going to be hard to punish them any worse after they get put to death and its the right cause its the right decision secondly there is other forms of racial profiling that goes on in america arabamericans are racially profiled in what is called secret evidence people are stopped and we have to do something about that my friend senator spencer abraham of michigan is pushing a law to make sure that arabamericans are treated with respect so racial profiling isnt just an issue at local police forces its an issue throughout our society and as we become a diverse society were going to have to deal with it more and more i believe though i believe as sure as im sitting here that most americans really care theyre tolerant people theyre good tolerant people its the very few that create most of the crises and we just have to find them and deal with them what if you become president governor are there other areas racial problem areas that you would deal with as president involving discrimination like you said arabamericans but also hispanics asians as well as blacks in this country let me tell you where the biggest discrimination comes in public education when we just move children through the schools my friend phyllis hunter is here she had one of the greatest lines of all lines she said reading is the new civil right shes right and to make sure our society is as hopeful as it possibly can be every single child in america must be educated i mean every child it starts with making sure every child learns to read k2 diagnostic testing so we know whether or not theres a deficiency curriculum that works and phonics needs to be an integral part of our reading curriculum intensive reading laboratories teacher retraining i mean there needs to be a wholesale effort against racial profiling which is illiterate children we can do better in our public schools we can close an achievement gap and it starts with making sure we have strong accountability jim one of the cornerstones of reform and good reform is to measure because when you measure you can ask the question do they know is anybody being profiled is anybody being discriminated against it becomes a tool a corrective tool and i believe the federal government must say that if you receive any money any money from the federal government for disadvantaged children for example you must show us whether or not the children are learning and if they are fine and if theyre not there has to be a consequence and so to make sure we end up getting rid of basic structural prejudice is education there is nothing more prejudiced than not educating a child vice president gore what would be on your racial discrimination elimination list as president well i think we need tough enforcement of the civil rights laws i think we still need affirmative action i would pass a hate crimes law as i said and i guess i had misunderstood the governors previous position the byrd family may have a misunderstanding of it in texas also but i would like to shift if i could to the big issue of education hold on one second what is the misunderstanding lets clear this up well i had thought that there was a controversy at the end of the legislative session where the hate crimes law in texas was failed and that the byrd family among others asked you to support it governor and it died in committee for lack of support am i wrong about that well you dont realize we have a hate crimes statute we do gore im talking about the one that was proposed to deal no well what the vice president must not understand is weve got a hate crimes bill in texas and secondly the people that murdered mr byrd got the ultimate punishment the death penalty they were prosecuted under the murder laws were they not in texas in this case when you murder somebody its hate jim the crime is hate and they got the ultimate punishment im not exactly sure how you enhance the penalty any more than the death penalty we happen to have a statute on the books thats a hate crimes statute in texas may i respond sure i dont want to jump in i may have been misled by all the news reports about this matter because the law that was proposed in texas that had the support of the byrd family and a whole lot of people in texas did in fact die in committee there may be some other statute that was already on the books but certainly the advocates of the hate crimes law felt that a tough new law was needed and its important jim not only not just because of texas but because this mirrors the national controversy there is pending now in the congress a national hate crimes law because of james byrd because of matthew shepard who was crucified on a split rail fence by bigots and because of others and that law has died in committee also because of the same kind of opposition and you would support that bill absolutely would you support a national hate crimes law i would support the orrin hatch version of it not the senator kennedy version but let me say to you mr vice president were happy with our laws on our books that bill did there was another bill that did die in committee but i want to repeat if you have a state that fully supports the law like we do in texas were going to go after all crime and were going to make sure people get punished for the crime and in this case we cant enhance the penalty any more than putting those three thugs to deaths and thats whats gonna happen in the state of texas new subject new question another vice presidential debate followup governor both senator lieberman and secretary cheney said they were sympathetically rethinking their views on same sex relationships whats your position on that im not for gay marriage i think marriage is a sacred institution between a man and a woman and i appreciated the way the administration signed the defense of marriage act i presume the vice president supported it when the president signed that bill and supports it now but i think marriage is a sacred institution im going to be respectful for people who may disagree with me ive had a record of doing so in the state of texas ive been a person that had been called a uniter not a divider because i accept other peoples points of view but i feel strongly that marriage should be between a man and a woman vice president gore i agree with that and i did support that law but i think that we should find a way to allow some kind of civic unions and i basically agree with dick cheney and joe lieberman and i think the three of us have one view and the governor has another view is that right im not sure what kind of view hes describing to me i can just tell you im a person who respects other people i respect their i respect on the one hand he says he agrees with me and then he says he doesnt im not sure where hes coming from but i will be a tolerant person ive been a tolerant person all my life i just happen to believe strongly that marriage is between a man and a woman do you believe in general terms that gays and lesbians should have the same rights as other americans yes i dont think they ought to have special rights but i think they ought to have the same rights well theres a law pending called the employment nondiscrimination act i strongly support it what it says is that gays and lesbians cant be fired from their job because theyre gay or lesbian and it would be a federal law preventing that now i wonder if the its been blocked by the opponents in the majority in the congress i wonder if the governor who lend his support to that law governor the question well but its a logical response well i have no idea i mean he can throw out all kinds i dont know the particulars of this law i will tell you im the kind of person i dont hire or fire somebody based upon their sexual orientation as a matter of fact i would like to take the issue a little further i dont really think its any of my you know any of my concerns what how you conduct your sex life and i think thats a private matter and i think thats the way it ought to be but im going to be respectful for people ill tolerate people and i support equal rights but not special rights for people special rights how does that affect gays and lesbians well it would be if theyre given special protective status that doesnt mean we shouldnt fully enforce laws and fully protect people and fully honor people which i will do as the president of the united states new subject new question vice president gore how do you see the connection between controlling gun sales in this country and the incidence of death by accidental or intentional use of guns jim i hope that we can come back to the subject of education because the governor made an extensive statement on it and i have a very different view than the one he expressed but that having been said i believe that well first of all let me say that the governor and i agree on some things where this subject is concerned i will not do anything to affect the rights of hunters or sportsmen i think that homeowners have to be respected and their right to have a gun if they wish to the problem i see is that there are too many guns getting into the hands of children and criminals and people who for whatever reason some kind of history of stalking or domestic abuse really should not be able to get guns i think these assault weapons are a problem so i favor closing the gun show loophole in fact i cast the tiebreaking vote to close it but then the majority in the house of representatives went the other way thats still pending if we could get agreement on that maybe they could pass that in the final days of this congress i think we ought to restore the threeday waiting period under the brady law i think we should toughen the enforcement of gun laws so that the ones that are already on the books can be enforced much more effectively some of the restrictions that have been placed by the congress in the last couple of years i think in the last few years i think have been unfortunate i think that we ought to make all schools gun free have a gunfree zone around every school in this country i think that measures like these are important child safety trigger locks on a mandatory basis and others governor well it starts with enforcing law when you say loud and clear to somebody if youre going to carry a gun illegally were going to arrest you if youre going to sell a gun illegally you need to be arrested if you commit a crime with a gun there needs to be absolute certainty in the law and that means that the local law enforcement officials need help at the federal level programs like project exile where the federal government intensifies arresting people who illegally use guns and we havent done a very good job of that at the federal level recently and im going to make it a priority secondly i dont think we ought to be selling guns to people who shouldnt have them thats why i support instant background checks at gun shows one of the reasons we have an instant background check is so that we instantly know whether or not somebody should have a gun or not in texas i tried to do something innovative theres a lot of talk about trigger locks being on guns sold in the future i support that but i said if you want a trigger lock to make your gun safe come and get one for free so were distributing in our state of texas for free i think we ought to raise the age at which a juvenile can carry a handgun from 18 to 21 i disagree with the vice president on this issue he is for registration of guns i think the only people that are going to show up to register or get a license i guess licensing like a drivers license for a gun the only people that are going to show up are lawabiding citizens the criminal is not going to show up and say hey give me my id card its the lawabiding citizens who will do that an i dont think that is going to be an effective tool to make the keep our society safe all right so on guns somebody wants to cast a vote based on your differences where are the differences well im not for registration i am for licensing by states of new handgun purchases whats that mean a photo license id like a drivers license for new handguns and you know the los angeles excuse me you would have to get the license a photo id to go in and before you could buy the gun correct all right who would issue the the state the state i think states should do that for new handguns because too many criminals are getting guns there was a recent investigation of the number in texas who got who were given concealed weapons permits in spite of the fact that they had records and the los angeles times spent a lot of ink going into that but i am not for doing anything that would affect hunters or sportsmen rifles shotguns existing handguns i do think that sensible gun safety measures are warranted now look this is the year this is in the aftermath of columbine and paducah and all the places in our country where the nation has been shocked by these weapons in the hands of the wrong people the woman who bought the guns for the two boys who did that killing at columbine said that if she had had to give her name and fill out a form there she would not have bought those guns that conceivably could have prevented that tragedy back to the question about the differences on gun control what are they governor from your point of view between you and the vice president well im not for photo licensing let me say something about columbine listen weve got gun laws he says we ought to have gunfree schools everybody believes that im sure every state in the union has got them you cant carry a gun into a school and there ought to be a consequence when you do carry a gun into a school but columbine spoke to a larger issue its really a matter of culture its a culture that somewhere along the line weve begun to disrespect life where a child can walk in and have their heart turned dark as a result of being on the internet and walk in and decide to take somebody elses life so gun laws are important no question about it but so is loving children and character education classes and faithbased programs being a part of afterschool programs some desperate child needs to have somebody put their arm around them and say we love you so theres a this is a society that of ours thats got to do a better job of teaching children right from wrong and we can enforce law but there seems to be a lot of preoccupation on not certainly only in this debate but just in general on law but theres a larger law love your neighbor like you would like to be loved yourself and thats where our society must head if were going to be a peaceful and prosperous society i also believe in the golden rule and i agree with a lot of the other things that the governor has said we do have a serious problem in our culture tipper and i have worked on the problem of violence in entertainment aimed at children shes worked on it longer than i have but i feel very strongly about that and if im elected president i will do something about that but i think that we i think we have to start with better parenting but i dont think that we can ignore the role played by guns i mean the fact is that there even though no state wants them there are guns in some schools and the reason its so difficult for schools to control that is because in recent years there has been a flood of cheap handguns that are so widely available that kids are finding ways to get ahold of them and i think that if you look at the situation as it exists here in the united states compared to any other country in the world it seems to me pretty obvious that while we respect the rights of hunters and sportsmen we do need some common sense gun safety steps to stem this flood of guns that are getting into the wrong hands yeah no question about that but there also needs to be strong enforcement of the law some kid who feels like doesnt matter where the gun comes from it could be a cheap gun expensive gun what matters is something in this persons head says there is not going to be a consequence so in my state we toughen up the juvenile justice laws we added beds were tough we believe in tough love we say if you get caught carrying a gun youre automatically detained and thats what needs to happen weve got laws if laws need to be strengthened like instant background checks thats important new question as i was saying both of you governor both of you have talked much about medicare and health care for seniors what about the more than 40 million younger americans who do not have health insurance right now what would you do about that well ive got a plan to do something about that its to make health care affordable and available this way first theres some who should be buying health care who choose not to theres some some of the 40 million some of the healthy folks healthy young kids say ill never get sick therefore i dont need health care right now for those what i think we need to do is to develop an investmenttype vehicle that would be an incentive for them to invest like medical savings accounts with rollover capacity in other words you say to a youngster it will be in your financial interest to start saving for future illness but for the working folks that do want to have health care that cant afford it a couple of things we need to do one we need more community health centers ive developed put out money in my budget to expand community health centers all around the country these are places where people can get primary care secondly and theyre good theyre very important parts of the safety net of health care secondly that you get a 2000 rebate from the government if youre a family of 30000 or less it scales down as you get higher that you can use to purchase health care in the private markets it will be a huge down payment for a pretty darn good system if you allow also allow convince states to allow states to allow the mother to match some of the childrens health insurance money with it the pool purchasing power and to make health care more affordable allow business associations like the national federal of independent business or the chamber of commerce or the national restaurant association to write association plans across jurisdictional lines so that small businesses have got the capacity to have national pooling to drive the cost of insurance down i think thats the very best way to go it empowers people it trusts people it makes and its a practical way to encourage people to purchase health care insurance vice president gore its one of my top priorities jim to give every single child in the united states affordable health care within the next four years i would like to see eventually in this country some form of universal health care but im not for a governmentrun system in fact im for shrinking the size of government i want a smaller and smarter government i have been in charge of this reinventing government streamlining project thats reduced the size of government by more than 300000 people in the last several years and the budget plan that ive put out according to the los angeles times again the way these things are typically measured as a percentage of the gdp will bring government spending down to the lowest level in 50 years so i want to proceed carefully to cover more people but i think we should start by greatly expanding the socalled child health insurance or chip program to give health insurance to every single child in this country i think its intolerable that we have so many millions of children without any health insurance so its one of my top priorities now i know that we have some disagreements on this and im sorry to tell you that you know there is a record here and texas ranks 49th out of the 50 states in health care in children with health care 49th for women with health care and 50th for families with health care so it is a priority for me i guarantee you im not aware of any program well ill just leave it at that i think it ought to be a top priority governor did the are the vice presidents figures correct about texas first of all let me say hes not for a governmentrun health care system i thought thats exactly what he and mrs clinton and them fought for in 1993 was a governmentrun health care system it was fortunately stopped in its tracks secondly we spend 47 billion a year on the uninsured in the state of texas our rate of uninsured the percentage of uninsured in texas has gone down while the percentage of uninsured in america has gone up our chips program got a late start because our government meets only four months out of every two years mr vice president it may come as a shock for somebody who has been in washington for so long but actually limited government can work in the second largest state in the union and therefore congress passes the bill after our session in 1997 ended we passed an enabling legislation in 1999 weve signed up over 110000 children to the chips program for comparable states our size were signing them up as fast as any other state you can quote all the numbers you want but im telling you we care about our people in texas we spent a lot of money to make sure people get health care in the state of texas and were doing a better job than they are at the national level for reducing uninsured is he right well i dont know about all these percentages that he throws out but i do know that i speculate that the reason why he didnt answer your question directly as to whether my numbers were right the facts were right about texas ranking dead last in families with health insurance and 49th out of 50 for both children and women is because those facts are correct and as for why it happened im no expert on the texas procedures but what my friends there tell me is that the governor opposed a measure put forward by democrats in the legislature to expand the number of children that would be covered and instead directed the money toward a tax cut a significant part of which went to wealthy interests he declared the need for a new tax cut for the oil companies in texas an emergency need and so the money was taken away from the chip program theres you dont have to take my word for this there is now a federal judges opinion about the current management of this program ordering the state of texas to do you should read that judges language about this i believe there are 14 million children in texas who do not have health insurance 600000 of whom and maybe some of those have since gotten it but as of a year ago 600000 of them were actually eligible for it but they couldnt sign up for it because of the barriers that they had set up lets let the governor respond to that are those numbers correct are his charges correct if hes trying to allege that im a hardhearted person and i dont care about children hes absolutely wrong weve spent 47 billion a year in the state of texas for uninsured people and they get health care now its not the most efficient way to get people health care but i want to remind you the number of uninsured in america during their watch has increased he can make any excuse he wants but the facts are that were reducing the number of uninsured percentage of our population and as the percentage of the population is increasing nationally somehow the allegation that we dont care and were going to give money for this interest or that interest and not for children in the state of texas is totally absurd let me just tell you who the jury is the people of texas theres only been one governor ever elected to backtoback fouryear terms and that was me and i was able to do so with a lot of democrat votes nearly 50 of the hispanic vote about 27 of the africanamerican vote because people know im a conservative person and a compassionate person so he can throw all the kinds of numbers around im just telling you our state comes together to do what is right we come together both republicans and democrats let me put that directly to you vice president gore the reason you brought this up is it are you suggesting that those numbers and that record will reflect the way governor bush will operate in this area of health insurance as president yes yes but its not a statement about his heart i dont claim to know his heart i think hes a good person i make no allegations about that i believe him when he says that he has a good heart i know enough about your story to admire a lot of the things that you have done as a person but i think its about his priorities and let me tell you exactly why i think that the choice he made to give a tax cut for the oil companies and others before addressing this i mean if you were the governor of a state that was dead last in health care for families and all of a sudden you found yourself with the biggest surplus your state had ever had in its history wouldnt you want to maybe use some of it to climb from 50th to say 45 or 40 or something or maybe better i would now but here is why its directly relevant jim because by his own budget numbers his proposals for spending on tax cuts for the wealthiest of the wealthy are more than the new spending proposals that he has made for health care and education and national defense all combined according to his own numbers so its not a question of his heart as far as i know its a question of priorities and values see you know let me ask first of all thats simply not true what he just said of course and secondly i repeat to you what is not true governor that we spent the top 1 receive 223 as opposed to 445 billion in new spending the top lets talk about my tax plan the top 1 will pay onethird of all the federal income taxes and in return get onefifth of the benefits because most of the tax reductions go to the people at the bottom end of the economic ladder that stands in stark contrast by the way to a man who is going to leave 50 million 50 million americans out of tax relief we just have a different point of view its a totally different point of view he believes only the right people ought to get tax relief i believe everybody who pays taxes ought to get tax relief let me go back to texas for example for a minute we pay 47 billion i cant emphasize to you how much i signed a bill that puts chips in place the bill finally came out at the end of the 1999 session were working hard to sign up children were doing it faster than any other state our size comparable state were making really good progress and our state cares a lot about our children my priority is going to be the health of our citizens these folks have had eight years to get something done in washington dc on the uninsured they have not done it theyve had eight years to get something done on medicare and they have not got it done and my case to the american people is if youre happy with inactivity stay with the horse the horse is up there now but if you want change you need to get somebody that knows how to bring republicans and democrats together to get positive things done for american new question new subject vice president gore on the environment in your 1992 book you said quote we must make the rescue of our environment the central organizing principle for civilization and there must be a wrenching transformation to save the planet do you still feel that way i do i think that in this 21st century we will soon see the consequences of whats called global warming there was a study just a few weeks ago suggesting that in summertime the north polar ice cap will be completely gone in 50 years already people see the strange weather conditions that the old timers say theyve never seen before in their lifetimes and whats happening is the level of pollution is increasing significantly now here is the good news jim if we take the leadership role and build the new technologies like the new kinds of cars and trucks that detroit is itching to build then we can create millions of good new jobs by being first into the market with these new kinds of cars and trucks and other kinds of technologies you know the japanese are breathing down our necks on this theyre moving very rapidly because they know that it is a fastgrowing world market some of these other countries particularly in the developing world their pollution is much worse than anywhere else and their people want higher standards of living and so theyre looking for ways to satisfy their desire for a better life and still reduce pollution at the same time i think that holding onto the old ways and the old argument that the environment and the economy are in conflict is really outdated we have to be bold we have to provide leadership now its true that we disagree on this the governor said that he doesnt think this problem is necessarily caused by people hes for letting the oil companies into the arctic national wildlife refuge houston has just become the smoggiest city in the country and texas is number one in industrial pollution we have a very different outlook and ill tell you this i will fight for a clean environment in ways that strengthen our economy governor well let me start with texas we are a big industrial state we reduced our industrial waste by 11 we cleaned up more brown fields than any other administration in my states history 450 of them our water is cleaner now explain what a brown field is to those who dont follow this a brown field is an abandoned industrial site that just sits idle in some of our urban centers and people are willing to invest capital in the brown fields dont want to do so for fear of lawsuit i think we ought to have federal liability protection depending upon whether or not standards have been met the book you mentioned that vice president gore wrote he also called for taxing big energy taxes in order to clean up the environment and now that the energy prices are high i guess hes not advocating those big energy taxes right now i believe we ought to fully fund the land and water conservation fund to with half the money going to states so states can make the right decisions for environmental quality i think we need to have clean coal technologies i propose 2 billion worth by the way i just found out the other day an interesting fact that there is a national petroleum reserve right next to in prudhoe bay that your administration opened up for exploration in that pristine area and it was a smart move because theres gas reserves up there we need gas pipelines to bring the gas down gas is a clean fuel that we can burn to we need to make sure that if we decontrol our plants that theres mandatory that the plants must conform to clean air standards the grandfathered plants thats what we did in texas no excuses you must conform in other words there are practical things we can do but it starts with working in a collaborative effort with states and local folks if you own the land every day is earth day people care a lot about their land and care about their environment not all wisdom is in washington dc on this issue where do you see the basic difference in very simple terms in two or three sentences between you and the governor on the environment if a voter wants to make a choice what is it im really strongly committed to clean water and clean air and cleaning up the new kinds of challenges like global warming he is right that im not in favor of energy taxes i am in favor of tax cuts to encourage and give incentives for the quicker development of these new kinds of technologies and let me say again detroit is rearing to go on that we differ on the arctic national wildlife refuge as i have said we differ on whether or not pollution controls ought to be voluntary i dont think you can i dont think you can get results that way we differ on the kinds of appointments that we would make would you say its a fundamental difference i think its a fundamental difference let me give you an example hold on one second okay sure weve talked about supply i just want to know for somebody were getting close to the end of our time here if somebody wanted to vote on the environment how would you draw the differences governor well i dont believe in command and control out of washington dc i believe washington ought to set standards but again i think we ought to be collaborative at the local levels and i think we ought to work with people at the local levels and by the way i just want to make sure i cant let him just say something and not correct it the electric decontrol bill that i fought for and signed in texas has mandatory emission standards mr vice president thats what we ought to do at the federal level when it comes to grandfathered plants for utilities i think theres a difference i think for example take when they took 40 million acres of land out of circulation without consulting local officials i thought that was that was out in the west out in the west yeah and so on the logging issue thats not the way i would have done it perhaps some of that land needs to be set aside but i certainly would have consulted with governors and elected officials before i would have acted unilaterally would you believe the federal government still has some new rules and new regulations and new laws to pass in the environmental area or do you think sure absolutely so long as theyre based upon science and theyre reasonable so long as people have input what about global warming i think its an issue that we need to take very seriously but i dont think we know the solution to global warming yet and i dont think weve got all the facts before we make decisions i tell you one thing im not going to do is im not going to let the united states carry the burden for cleaning up the worlds air like kyoto treaty would have done china and india were exempted from that treaty i think we need to be more evenhanded as evidently 99 senators i think it was 99 senators supported that position global warming the senate did turn it down i think 99 to nothing well that vote wasnt exactly a lot of the supporters of the kyoto treaty actually ended up voting for that because the way it was worded but theres no doubt theres a lot of opposition to it in the senate im not for command and control techniques either im for working with the groups not just with industry but also with the citizen groups and local communities to control sprawl in ways that the local communities themselves come up with but i disagree that we dont know the cause of global warming i think that we do its pollution carbon dioxide and other chemicals that are even more potent but in smaller quantities that cause this look the worlds temperature is going up weather patterns are changing storms are getting more violent and unpredictable what are we going to tell our children im a grandfather now i want to be able to tell my grandson when im in my later years that i didnt turn away from the evidence that showed that we were doing some serious harm in my faith tradition it is its written in the book of matthew where your heart is there is your treasure also and i believe that that we ought to recognize the value to our children and grandchildren of taking steps that preserve the environment in a way thats good for them yeah i agree i just i think there has been some of the scientists i believe mr vice president havent they been changing their opinion a little bit on global warming a profound scientist recently made a different both of you have now violated excuse me both of you have now violated your own rules hold that thought ive been trying so hard not to i know i know but under your alls rules you are not allowed to ask each other a question i let you do it a moment ago twice now you just twice sorry thats an interruption by the way thats an interruption okay but anyhow you just did it so now im sorry i apologize mr vice president you arent allowed to do that either see im sorry go ahead and finish your thought people care about these things ive found out of course they care about them oh you mean the rules yeah right exactly right go ahead what the heck i of course theres a lot look global warming needs to be taken very seriously and i take it seriously but science theres a lot theres differing opinions and before we react i think its best to have the full accounting full understanding of whats taking place and i think to answer your question i think both of us care a lot about the environment we may have different approaches we may have different approaches in terms of how we deal with local folks i just cited an example of the administration just unilaterally acting without any input and i remember you gave a very good answer to new hampshire about the white mountains about how it was important to keep that collaborative effort in place i feel very strongly the same place it certainly wasnt the attitude that took place out west however new question last question for you governor and this flows somewhat out of the boston debate you your running mate your campaign officials have charged that vice president gore exaggerates embellishes and stretches the facts etcetera are you do you believe these are serious issues this is a serious issue that the voters should use in deciding which one of you two men to vote for on november 7 well we all make mistakes ive been known to mangle a syllable or two myself you know if you know what i mean i think credibility is important it is going to be important for the president to be credible with congress important for the president to be credible with foreign nations and yes i think its something that people need to consider this isnt something new i read a report or a memo from somebody in his 1988 campaign i forgot the fellows name warning then senator gore to be careful about exaggerating claims i thought during his debate with senator bradley saying he authored the eitc when it didnt happen i mention the last debate eitc the earned income tax credit sorry thats all right a lot of initials from a guy whos not from washington isnt it anyway he cosponsored mccainfeingold and yet he didnt and so i think this is an issue i found it to be an issue in trying to defend my tax relief package i thought there was some exaggerations about the numbers but the people are going to have to make up their mind on this issue and i am going to continue to defend my record and defend my propositions against what i think are exaggerations exaggerations like for example only 5 of seniors receive benefits under my medicare reform package thats what he said the other day and thats simply not the case and i have every right in the world to defend my record and positions thats what debates are about and thats what campaigns are about vice president gore i got some of the details wrong last week in some of the examples that i used jim and im sorry about that and im going to try to do better one of the reasons i regret it is that getting a detail wrong interfered several times with the point that i was trying to make however many days that young girl in florida stood in her classroom however long even if it was only one day doesnt change the fact that there are a lot of overcrowded classrooms in america and we need to do something about that there are seniors who pay more for their prescriptions than a lot of other people more than their pets sometimes more sometimes than people in foreign countries and we need to do something about that not with the measure that leaves the majority of them without any real basic help until the next presidents term of four years is over but right away and that means doing it under the medicare program i cant promise that i will never get another detail wrong i can promise you that i will try not to and hard but i will promise you this with all the confidence in my heart and in the world that i will do my best if im elected president ill work my heart out to get the big things right for the american people does that resolve the issue governor thats going to be up to the people isnt it does it resolve it for you depends on what he says in the future in the campaign your folks are saying some awful things i hope theyre not awful things i think they may be using the mans own words well what i mean is calling him a serial exaggerator i dont believe ive used those words no but your campaign ads maybe they have and your campaign officials have and your campaign officials mr vice president are now calling the governor a bumbler wait a minute i mean my point is should this is this i dont use language like that and i dont think that we should its in your commercial i understand the i havent seen that in my commercials you havent seen the commercial your i think that what i think the point of that is that anybody would have a hard time trying to make a tax cut plan that is so large that would put us into such big deficits that gives almost half the benefits to the wealthiest of the wealthy i think anybody would have a hard time explaining that clearly in a way that makes sense to the average person thats the kind of exaggeration i was just talking about well i wasnt the one having trouble explaining it gentlemen its time to go to the closing statements and vice president gore you have two minutes jim one of the issues that i would like to close with in my statement is education because its an example of the overall approach that i think is important this race is about values its about change its about giving choices to the american people and education is my number one priority because i think that its the most important big major change that we can bring in our country i agree with governor bush that we should have new accountability testing of students i think that we should require states to test all students test schools and school districts and i think that we should go further and require teacher testing for new teachers also the difference is that while my plan starts with new accountability and maintains local control it doesnt stop there because i want to give new choices to parents to send their kids to college with a 10000 tax deduction for college tuition per child per year i want to reduce the size of the classrooms in this country for one basic reason so that students can get more oneonone time with teachers and the way to do that is first to recruit more teachers ive a plan in my budget to recruit 100000 new highly qualified teachers and to help local school districts build new schools i think that we have to put more emphasis on early learning and preschool now here is how that connects with all the rest of what weve been talking about if you have if you squander the surplus on a huge tax cut that goes mostly to those at the top then you cant make education the top priority if the tax cut is your number one two three and four priority you cant do education you cant do both you have to choose i choose education and health care the environment and retirement security and i ask for your support governor bush two minutes jim thank you very much mr vice president thank you very much and i would like to thank the folks here at wake forest and i want to thank you all for listening im running to get some things done for america theres too many issues left unresolved theres been too much finger pointing and too much name calling in washington dc i would like to unite this country to get an agenda done that will speak to the hopes and aspirations of the future i want to have an education system that sets high standards local control of schools and strong accountability no child should be left behind in america i want to make sure we rebuild our military to keep the peace i worry about morale in todays military the warning signs are clear it is time to have a new commander in chief who will rebuild the military pay our men and women more make sure theyre housed better and have a focused mission for our military once and for all i want to do something about medicare this issue has been too long on the table because its been a political issue its time to bring folks together to say that all seniors will get prescription drug coverage i want to do something about social security its an important priority because now is the time to act and were going to say to our seniors our promises weve made to you will be promises kept but younger workers in order to make sure the system exists tomorrow younger workers ought to be able to take some of your own money and invest it in safe securities to get a better rate of return on that money and finally i do believe in tax relief i believe we can set our priorities i dont believe like the vice president does in huge government i believe in limited government by having a limited government and a focused government we can send some of the money back to the people who pay the bills i want to have tax relief for all people who pay the bills in america because i think you can spend your money more wisely than the federal government can thank you for listening im asking for your vote and god bless and we will return next tuesday night october 17th from washington university in st louis for the third and final debate thank you vice president gore governor bush see you next week for now from winstonsalem im jim lehrer thank you and good night 
 debate transcript october 13 2004 the third bushkerry presidential debate third presidential candidates debate arizona state university tempe arizona speakers george w bush president of the united states u s senator john f kerry ma democratic presidential nominee bob schieffer cbs anchor good evening from arizona state university in tempe arizona im bob schieffer of cbs news i want to welcome you to the third and last of the 2004 debates between president george bush and senator john kerry as jim lehrer told you before the first one these debates are sponsored by the commission on presidential debates tonight the topic will be domestic affairs but the format will be the same as that first debate ill moderate our discussion under detailed rules agreed to by the candidates but the questions and the areas to be covered were chosen by me i have not told the candidates or anyone else what they are to refresh your memory on the rules i will ask a question the candidate is allowed two minutes to answer his opponent then has a minute and a half to offer a rebuttal at my discretion i can extend the discussion by offering each candidate an additional 30 seconds a green light will come on to signal the candidate has 30 seconds left a yellow light signals 15 seconds left a red light means five seconds left there is also a buzzer if it is needed the candidates may not question each other directly there are no opening statements but there will be twominute closing statements there is an audience here tonight but they have agreed to remain silent except for right now when they join me in welcoming president george bush and senator john kerry gentlemen welcome to you both by coin toss the first question goes to senator kerry senator i want to set the stage for this discussion by asking the question that i think hangs over all of our politics today and is probably on the minds of many people watching this debate tonight and that is will our children and grandchildren ever live in a world as safe and secure as the world in which we grew up well first of all bob thank you for moderating tonight thank you arizona state for welcoming us and thank you to the presidential commission for undertaking this enormous task were proud to be here mr president im glad to be here with you again to share similarities and differences with the american people will we ever be safe and secure again yes we absolutely must be thats the goal now how do we achieve it is the most critical component of it i believe that this president regrettably rushed us into a war made decisions about foreign policy pushed alliances away and as a result america is now bearing this extraordinary burden where we are not as safe as we ought to be the measurement is not are we safer the measurement is are we as safe as we ought to be and there are a host of options that this president had available to him like making sure that at all our ports in america containers are inspected only 95 percent of them 95 percent come in today uninspected thats not good enough people who fly on airplanes today the cargo hold is not xrayed but the baggage is thats not good enough firehouses dont have enough firefighters in them police officers are being cut from the streets of america because the president decided to cut the cops program so we can do a better job of homeland security i can do a better job of waging a smarter more effective war on terror and guarantee that we will go after the terrorists i will hunt them down and well kill them well capture them well do whatever is necessary to be safe but i pledge this to you america i will do it in the way that franklin roosevelt and ronald reagan and john kennedy and others did where we build the strongest alliances where the world joins together where we have the best intelligence and where we are able ultimately to be more safe and secure mr president you have 90 seconds thank you very much i want to thank arizona state as well yes we can be safe and secure if we stay on the offense against the terrorists and if we spread freedom and liberty around the world i have got a comprehensive strategy to not only chase down the al qaida wherever it exists and were making progress threequarters of al qaida leaders have been brought to justice but to make sure that countries that harbor terrorists are held to account as a result of securing ourselves and ridding the taliban out of afghanistan the afghan people had elections this weekend and the first voter was a 19yearold woman think about that freedom is on the march we held to account a terrorist regime in saddam hussein in other words in order to make sure were secure there must be a comprehensive plan my opponent just this weekend talked about how terrorism could be reduced to a nuisance comparing it to prostitution illegal gambling i think that attitude and that point of view is dangerous i dont think you can secure america for the long run if you dont have a comprehensive view as to how to defeat these people at home well do everything we can to protect the homeland i signed the homeland security bill to better align our assets and resources my opponent voted against it were doing everything we can to protect our borders and ports but absolutely we can be secure in the long run it just takes good strong leadership anything to add senator kerry yes when the president had an opportunity to capture or kill osama bin laden he took his focus off of them outsourced the job to afghan warlords and osama bin laden escaped six months after he said osama bin laden must be caught dead or alive this president was asked where is osama bin laden he said i dont know i dont really think about him very much im not that concerned we need a president who stays deadly focused on the real war on terror mr president gosh i just dont think i ever said im not worried about osama bin laden its kind of one of those exaggerations of course were worried about osama bin laden were on the hunt after osama bin laden were using every asset at our disposal to get osama bin laden my opponent said this war is a matter of intelligence and law enforcement no this war is a matter of using every asset at our disposal to keep the american people protected new question mr president to you we are talking about protecting ourselves from the unexpected but the flu season is suddenly upon us flu kills thousands of people every year suddenly we find ourselves with a severe shortage of flu vaccine how did that happen bob we relied upon a company out of england to provide about half of the flu vaccines for the united states citizen and it turned out that the vaccine they were producing was contaminated and so we took the right action and didnt allow contaminated medicine into our country were working with canada to hopefully that theyll produce a help us realize the vaccine necessary to make sure our citizens have got flu vaccinations during this upcoming season my call to our fellow americans is if youre healthy if youre younger dont get a flu shot this year help us prioritize those who need to get the flu shot the elderly and the young the cdc responsible for health in the united states is setting those priorities and is allocating the flu vaccine accordingly i havent gotten a flu shot and i dont intend to because i want to make sure those who are most vulnerable get treated we have a problem with litigation in the united states of america vaccine manufacturers are worried about getting sued and therefore they have backed off from providing this kind of vaccine one of the reasons im such a strong believer in legal reform is so that people arent afraid of producing a product that is necessary for the health of our citizens and then end up getting sued in a court of law but the best thing we can do now bob given the circumstances with the company in england is for those of us who are younger and healthy dont get a flu shot senator kerry this really underscores the problem with the american healthcare system its not working for the american family and its gotten worse under president bush over the course of the last years five million americans have lost their health insurance in this country youve got about a million right here in arizona just shy 950000 who have no health insurance at all 82000 arizonians lost their health insurance under president bushs watch 223000 kids in arizona have no health insurance at all all across our country go to ohio 1 4 million ohioans have no health insurance 114000 of them lost it under president bush wisconsin 82000 wisconsinites lost it under president bush this president has turned his back on the wellness of america and there is no system in fact its starting to fall apart not because of lawsuits though they are a problem and john edwards and i are committed to fixing them but because of the larger issue that we dont cover americans children across our country dont have health care were the richest country on the face of the planet the only industrialized nation in the world not to do it i have a plan to cover all americans were going to make it affordable and accessible were going to let everybody buy into the same healthcare plan senators and congressmen give themselves mr president would you like to add something i would thank you i want to remind people listening tonight that a plan is not a litany of complaints and a plan is not to lay out programs that you cant pay for he just said he wants everybody to be able to buy in to the same plan that senators and congressmen get that costs the government 7700 per family if every family in america signed up like the senator suggested if would cost us 5 trillion over 10 years its an empty promise its called bait and switch times up thank you actually its not an empty promise its really interesting because the president used that very plan as a reason for seniors to accept his prescription drug plan he said if its good enough for the congressmen and senators to have choice seniors ought to have choice what we do is we have choice i choose blue crossblue shield other senators other congressmen choose other programs but the fact is were going to help americans be able to buy into it those that can afford it are going to buy in themselves were not giving this away for nothing all right senator kerry a new question lets talk about economic security you pledged during the last debate that you would not raise taxes on those making less than 200000 a year but the price of everything is going up and we all know it healthcare costs as you are talking about is skyrocketing the cost of the war my question is how can you or any president whoever is elected next time keep that pledge without running this country deeper into debt and passing on more of the bills that were running up to our children ill tell you exactly how i can do it by reinstating what president bush took away which is called pay as you go during the 1990s we had payasyougo rules if you were going to pass something in the congress you had to show where you are going to pay for it and how president bush has taken hes the only president in history to do this hes also the only president in 72 years to lose jobs 1 6 million jobs lost hes the only president to have incomes of families go down for the last three years the only president to see exports go down the only president to see the lowest level of business investment in our country as it is today now im going to reverse that im going to change that were going to restore the fiscal discipline we had in the 1990s every plan that i have laid out my healthcare plan my plan for education my plan for kids to be able to get better college loans ive shown exactly how im going to pay for those and we start we dont do it exclusively but we start by rolling back george bushs unaffordable tax cut for the wealthiest people people earning more than 200000 a year and we pass hopefully the mccainkerry commission which identified some 60 billion that we can get we shut the loophole which has american workers actually subsidizing the loss of their own job they just passed an expansion of that loophole in the last few days 43 billion of giveaways including favors to the oil and gas industry and the people importing ceiling fans from china im going to stand up and fight for the american worker and i am going to do it in a way thats fiscally sound i show how i pay for the health care how we pay for the education i have a manufacturing jobs credit we pay for it by shutting that loophole overseas we raise the student loans i pay for it by changing the relationship with the banks this president has never once vetoed one bill the first president in a hundred years not to do that mr president well his rhetoric doesnt match his record he been a senator for 20 years he voted to increase taxes 98 times when they tried to reduce taxes he voted against that 127 times he talks about being a fiscal conservative or fiscally sound but he voted over he voted 277 times to waive the budget caps which would have cost the taxpayers 4 2 trillion he talks about paygo ill tell you what paygo means when youre a senator from massachusetts when youre a colleague of ted kennedy pay go means you pay and he goes ahead and spends hes proposed 2 2 trillion of new spending and yet the socalled tax on the rich which is also a tax on many smallbusiness owners in america raises 600 million by our account billion 800 billion by his account there is a tax gap and guess who usually ends up filling the tax gap the middle class i propose a detailed budget bob i sent up my budget man to the congress and he says heres how were going to reduce the deficit in half by five years it requires progrowth policies that grow our economy and fiscal sanity in the halls of congress lets go to a new question mr president two minutes and lets continue on jobs you know there are all kind of statistics out there but i want to bring it down to an individual mr president what do you say to someone in this country who has lost his job to someone overseas whos being paid a fraction of what that job paid here in the united states id say bob ive got policies to continue to grow our economy and create the jobs of the 21st century and heres some help for you to go get an education heres some help for you to go to a community college weve expanded trade adjustment assistance we want to help pay for you to gain the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century you know theres a lot of talk about how to keep the economy growing we talk about fiscal matters but perhaps the best way to keep jobs here in america and to keep this economy growing is to make sure our education system works i went to washington to solve problems and i saw a problem in the public education system in america they were just shuffling too many kids through the system year after year grade after grade without learning the basics and so we said lets raise the standards were spending more money but lets raise the standards and measure early and solve problems now before its too late no education is how to help the person whos lost a job education is how to make sure weve got a workforce thats productive and competitive got four more years ive got more to do to continue to raise standards to continue to reward teachers and school districts that are working to emphasize math and science in the classrooms to continue to expand pell grants to make sure that people have an opportunity to start their career with a college diploma and so the person you talked to i say heres some help heres some trade adjustment assistance money for you to go a community college in your neighborhood a community college which is providing the skills necessary to fill the jobs of the 21st century and thats what i would say to that person senator kerry i want you to notice how the president switched away from jobs and started talking about education principally let me come back in one moment to that but i want to speak for a second if i can to what the president said about fiscal responsibility being lectured by the president on fiscal responsibility is a little bit like tony soprano talking to me about law and order in this country this president has taken a 5 6 trillion surplus and turned it into deficits as far as the eye can see healthcare costs for the average american have gone up 64 percent tuitions have gone up 35 percent gasoline prices up 30 percent medicare premiums went up 17 percent a few days ago prescription drugs are up 12 percent a year but guess what america the wages of americans have gone down the jobs that are being created in arizona right now are paying about 13700 less than the jobs that were losing and the president just walks on by this problem the fact is that hes cut jobtraining money 1 billion was cut they only added a little bit back this year because its an election year theyve cut the pell grants and the perkins loans to help kids be able to go to college theyve cut the training money theyve wound up not even extending unemployment benefits and not even extending health care to those people who are unemployed im going to do those things because thats whats right in america help workers to transition in every respect new question to you senator kerry two minutes and its still on jobs you know many experts say that a president really doesnt have much control over jobs for example if someone invents a machine that does the work of five people thats progress thats not the presidents fault so i ask you is it fair to blame the administration entirely for this loss of jobs i dont blame them entirely for it i blame the president for the things the president could do that has an impact on it outsourcing is going to happen ive acknowledged that in union halls across the country ive had shop stewards stand up and say will you promise me youre going to stop all this outsourcing and ive looked them in the eye and ive said no i cant do that what i can promise you is that i will make the playing field as fair as possible that i will for instance make certain that with respect to the tax system that you as a worker in america are not subsidizing the loss of your job today if youre an american business you actually get a benefit for going overseas you get to defer your taxes so if youre looking at a competitive world you say to yourself hey i do better overseas than i do here in america thats not smart i dont want american workers subsidizing the loss of their own job and when im president were going to shut that loophole in a nanosecond and were going to use that money to lower corporate tax rates in america for all corporations 5 percent and were going to have a manufacturing jobs credit and a job hiring credit so we actually help people be able to hire here the second thing that we can do is provide a fair trade playing field this president didnt stand up for boeing when airbus was violating international rules and subsidies he discovered boeing during the course of this campaign after id been talking about it for months the fact is that the president had an opportunity to stand up and take on china for currency manipulation there are companies that wanted to petition the administration they were told dont even bother were not going to listen to it the fact is that there have been markets shut to us that we havent stood up and fought for im going to fight for a fair trade playing field for the american worker and i will fight for the american worker just as hard as i fight for my own job thats what the american worker wants and if we do that we can have an impact plus we need fiscal discipline restore fiscal discipline well do a lot better mr president whew let me start with the pell grants in his last litany of misstatements he said we cut pell grants weve increased pell grants by a million students thats a fact you know he talks to the workers let me talk to the workers youve got more money in your pocket as a result of the tax relief we passed and he opposed if you have a child you got a 1000 child credit thats money in your pocket if youre married we reduced the marriage penalty the code ought to encourage marriage not discourage marriage we created a 10 percent bracket to help lowerincome americans a family of four making 40000 received about 1700 in tax relief its your money the way my opponent talks he said were going to spend the governments money no were spending your money and when you have more money in your pocket youre able to better afford things you want i believe the role of government is to stand side by side with our citizens to help them realize their dreams not tell citizens how to live their lives my opponent talks about fiscal sanity his record in the united states senate does not match his rhetoric he voted to increase taxes 98 times and to bust the budget 277 times senator kerry bob anybody can play with these votes everybody knows that i have supported or voted for tax cuts over 600 times i broke with my party in order to balance the budget and ronald reagan signed into law the tax cut that we voted for i voted for ira tax cuts i voted for smallbusiness tax cuts but you know why the pell grants have gone up in their numbers because more people qualify for them because they dont have money but theyre not getting the 5100 the president promised them theyre getting less money we have more people who qualify thats not what we want senator no ones playing with your votes you voted to increase taxes 98 times when they voted when they proposed reducing taxes you voted against it 126 times he voted to violate the budget cap 277 times you know theres a main stream in american politics and you sit right on the far left bank as a matter of fact your record is such that ted kennedy your colleague is the conservative senator from massachusetts mr president lets get back to economic issues but lets shift to some other questions here both of you are opposed to gay marriage but to understand how you have come to that conclusion i want to ask you a more basic question do you believe homosexuality is a choice you know bob i dont know i just dont know i do know that we have a choice to make in america and that is to treat people with tolerance and respect and dignity its important that we do that and i also know in a free society people consenting adults can live the way they want to live and thats to be honored but as we respect someones rights and as we profess tolerance we shouldnt change or have to change our basic views on the sanctity of marriage i believe in the sanctity of marriage i think its very important that we protect marriage as an institution between a man and a woman i proposed a constitutional amendment the reason i did so was because i was worried that activist judges are actually defining the definition of marriage and the surest way to protect marriage between a man and woman is to amend the constitution it has also the benefit of allowing citizens to participate in the process after all when you amend the constitution state legislatures must participate in the ratification of the constitution im deeply concerned that judges are making those decisions and not the citizenry of the united states you know congress passed a law called doma the defense of marriage act my opponent was against it it basically protected states from the action of one state to another it also defined marriage as between a man and woman but im concerned that that will get overturned and if it gets overturned then well end up with marriage being defined by courts and i dont think thats in our nations interests senator kerry were all gods children bob and i think if you were to talk to dick cheneys daughter who is a lesbian she would tell you that shes being who she was shes being who she was born as i think if you talk to anybody its not choice ive met people who struggled with this for years people who were in a marriage because they were living a sort of convention and they struggled with it and ive met wives who are supportive of their husbands or vice versa when they finally sort of broke out and allowed themselves to live who they were who they felt god had made them i think we have to respect that the president and i share the belief that marriage is between a man and a woman i believe that i believe marriage is between a man and a woman but i also believe that because we are the united states of america were a country with a great unbelievable constitution with rights that we afford people that you cant discriminate in the workplace you cant discriminate in the rights that you afford people you cant disallow someone the right to visit their partner in a hospital you have to allow people to transfer property which is why im for partnership rights and so forth now with respect to doma and the marriage laws the states have always been able to manage those laws and theyre proving today every state that they can manage them adequately senator kerry a new question for you the new york times reports that some catholic archbishops are telling their church members that it would be a sin to vote for a candidate like you because you support a womans right to choose an abortion and unlimited stemcell research what is your reaction to that i respect their views i completely respect their views i am a catholic and i grew up learning how to respect those views but i disagree with them as do many i believe that i cant legislate or transfer to another american citizen my article of faith what is an article of faith for me is not something that i can legislate on somebody who doesnt share that article of faith i believe that choice is a womans choice its between a woman god and her doctor and thats why i support that now i will not allow somebody to come in and change roe v wade the president has never said whether or not he would do that but we know from the people hes tried to appoint to the court he wants to i will not i will defend the right of roe v wade now with respect to religion you know as i said i grew up a catholic i was an altar boy i know that throughout my life this has made a difference to me and as president kennedy said when he ran for president he said im not running to be a catholic president im running to be a president who happens to be catholic my faith affects everything that i do in truth theres a great passage of the bible that says what does it mean my brother to say you have faith if there are no deeds faith without works is dead and i think that everything you do in public life has to be guided by your faith affected by your faith but without transferring it in any official way to other people thats why i fight against poverty thats why i fight to clean up the environment and protect this earth thats why i fight for equality and justice all of those things come out of that fundamental teaching and belief of faith but i know this that president kennedy in his inaugural address told all of us that here on earth gods work must truly be our own and thats what we have to i think thats the test of public service mr president i think its important to promote a culture of life i think a hospitable society is a society where every being counts and every person matters i believe the ideal world is one in which every child is protected in law and welcomed to life i understand theres great differences on this issue of abortion but i believe reasonable people can come together and put good law in place that will help reduce the number of abortions take for example the ban on partial birth abortion its a brutal practice people from both political parties came together in the halls of congress and voted overwhelmingly to ban that practice it made a lot of sense my opponent in that hes out of the mainstream voted against that law what im saying is is that as we promote life and promote a culture of life surely there are ways we can work together to reduce the number of abortions continue to promote adoption laws its a great alternative to abortion continue to fund and promote maternity group homes i will continue to promote abstinence programs the last debate my opponent said his wife was involved with those programs thats great i appreciate that very much all of us ought to be involved with programs that provide a viable alternative to abortion mr president lets have a new question it goes to you and lets get back to economic issues health insurance costs have risen over 36 percent over the last four years according to the washington post were paying more were getting less i would like to ask you who bears responsibility for this is it the government is it the insurance companies is it the lawyers is it the doctors is it the administration gosh i sure hope its not the administration theres a no look theres a systemic problem healthcare costs are on the rise because the consumers are not involved in the decisionmaking process most healthcare costs are covered by third parties and therefore the actual user of health care is not the purchaser of health care and theres no market forces involved with health care its one of the reasons im a strong believer in what they call health savings accounts these are accounts that allow somebody to buy a lowpremium highdeductible catastrophic plan and couple it with taxfree savings businesses can contribute employees can contribute on a contractual basis but this is a way to make sure people are actually involved with the decisionmaking process on health care secondly i do believe the lawsuits i dont believe i know that the lawsuits are causing healthcare costs to rise in america thats why im such a strong believer in medical liability reform in the last debate my opponent said those lawsuits only caused the cost to go up by 1 percent well he didnt include the defensive practice of medicine that costs the federal government some 28 billion a year and costs our society between 60 billion and 100 billion a year thirdly one of the reasons why theres still high cost in medicine is because this is they dont use any information technology its like if you looked at the its the equivalent of the buggy and horse days compared to other industries here in america and so weve got to introduce high technology into health care were beginning to do it were changing the language we want there to be electronic medical records to cut down on error as well as reduce cost people tell me that when the healthcare field is fully integrated with information technology itll wring some 20 percent of the cost out of the system and finally moving generic drugs to the market quicker and so those are four ways to help control the costs in health care senator kerry the reason healthcare costs are getting higher one of the principal reasons is that this administration has stood in the way of commonsense efforts that would have reduced the costs let me give you a prime example in the senate we passed the right of americans to import drugs from canada but the president and his friends took it out in the house and now you dont have that right the president blocked you from the right to have less expensive drugs from canada we also wanted medicare to be able to negotiate bulk purchasing the va does that the va provides lowercost drugs to our veterans we could have done that in medicare medicare is paid for by the american taxpayer medicare belongs to you medicare is for seniors who many of them are on fixed income to lift them out of poverty but rather than help you the taxpayer have lower cost rather than help seniors have less expensive drugs the president made it illegal illegal for medicare to actually go out and bargain for lower prices result 139 billion windfall profit to the drug companies coming out of your pockets thats a large part of your 17 percent increase in medicare premiums when im president im sending that back to congress and were going to get a real prescription drug benefit now we also have people sicker because they dont have health insurance so whether its diabetes or cancer they come to hospitals later and it costs america more we got to have health care for all americans go ahead mr president i think its important since he talked about the medicare plan has he been in the united states senate for 20 years he has no record on reforming of health care no record at all he introduced some 300 bills and hes passed five no record of leadership i came to washington to solve problems i was deeply concerned about seniors having to choose between prescription drugs and food and so i led and in 2006 our seniors will get a prescription drug coverage in medicare senator kerry thirty seconds once again the president is misleading america ive actually passed 56 individual bills that ive personally written and in addition to that and not always under my name there is amendments on certain bills but more importantly with respect to the question of no record i helped write i did write i was one of the original authors of the early childhood health care and the expansion of health care that we did in the middle of the 1990s and im very proud of that so the presidents wrong let me direct the next question to you senator kerry and again lets stay on health care you have as you have proposed and as the president has commented on tonight proposed a massive plan to extend healthcare coverage to children youre also talking about the government picking up a big part of the catastrophic bills that people get at the hospital and you have said that you can pay for this by rolling back the presidents tax cut on the upper 2 percent you heard the president say earlier tonight that its going to cost a whole lot more money than that id just ask you where are you going to get the money well two leading national news networks have both said the presidents characterization of my healthcare plan is incorrect one called it fiction the other called it untrue the fact is that my healthcare plan america is very simple it gives you the choice i dont force you to do anything its not a government plan the government doesnt require you to do anything you choose your doctor you choose your plan if you dont want to take the offer of the plan that i want to put forward you dont have do you can keep what you have today keep a high deductible keep high premiums keep a high copay keep low benefits but i got a better plan and i dont think a lot of people are going to want to keep what they have today heres what i do we take over medicaid children from the states so that every child in america is covered and in exchange if the states want to theyre not forced to they can choose to they cover individuals up to 300 percent of poverty its their choice i think theyll choose it because its a net plus of 5 billion to them we allow you if you choose to you dont have to but we give you broader competition to allow you to buy into the same health care plan that senators and congressmen give themselves if its good enough for us its good enough for every american i believe that your health care is just as important as any politician in washington d c you want to buy into it you can we give you broader competition that helps lower prices in addition to that were going to allow people 55 to 64 to buy into medicare early and most importantly we give small business a 50 percent tax credit so that after we lower the costs of health care they also get whether theyre selfemployed or a small business a lower cost to be able to cover their employees now what happens is when you begin to get people covered like that for instance in diabetes if you diagnose diabetes early you could save 50 billion in the health care system of america by avoiding surgery and dialysis it works and im going to offer it to america mr president in all due respect im not so sure its credible to quote leading news organizations about oh never mind anyway let me quote the lewin report the lewin report is a group of folks who are not politically affiliated they analyzed the senators plan it cost 12 trillion the lewin report accurately noted that there are going to be 20 million people over 20 million people added to governmentcontrolled health care it would be the largest increase in government health care ever if you raise the medicaid to 300 percent it provides an incentive for small businesses not to provide private insurance to their employees why should they insure somebody when the governments going to insure it for them its estimated that 8 million people will go from private insurance to government insurance we have a fundamental difference of opinion i think government run health will lead to poorquality health will lead to rationing will lead to less choice once a healthcare program ends up in a line item in the federal government budget it leads to more controls and just look at other countries that have tried to have federally controlled health care they have poorquality health care our healthcare system is the envy of the world because we believe in making sure that the decisions are made by doctors and patients not by officials in the nations capital senator the president just said that governmentrun health care results in poor quality now maybe that explains why he hasnt fully funded the va and the va hospital is having trouble and veterans are complaining maybe that explains why medicare patients are complaining about being pushed off of medicare he doesnt adequately fund it but let me just say to america i am not proposing a governmentrun program thats not what i have i have blue crossblue shield senators and congressmen have a wide choice americans ought to have it too mr president talk about the va weve increased va funding by 22 billion in the four years since ive been president thats twice the amount that my predecessor increased va funding of course were meeting our obligation to our veterans and the veterans know that were expanding veterans health care throughout the country were aligning facilities where the veterans live now veterans are getting very good health care under my administration and they will continue to do so during the next four years mr president the next question is to you we all know that social security is running out of money and it has to be fixed you have proposed to fix it by letting people put some of the money collected to pay benefits into private savings accounts but the critics are saying thats going to mean finding 1 trillion over the next 10 years to continue paying benefits as those accounts are being set up so where do you get the money are you going to have to increase the deficit by that much over 10 years first let me make sure that every senior listening today understands that when were talking about reforming social security that theyll still get their checks i remember the 2000 campaign people said if george w gets elected your check will be taken away well people got their checks and theyll continue to get their checks there is a problem for our youngsters a real problem and if we dont act today the problem will be valued in the trillions and so i think we need to think differently well honor our commitment to our seniors but for our children and our grandchildren we need to have a different strategy and recognizing that i called together a group of our fellow citizens to study the issue it was a committee chaired by the late senator daniel patrick moynihan of new york a democrat and they came up with a variety of ideas for people to look at i believe that younger workers ought to be allowed to take some of their own money and put it in a personal savings account because i understand that they need to get better rates of return than the rates of return being given in the current social security trust and the compounding rate of interest effect will make it more likely that the social security system is solvent for our children and our grandchildren i will work with republicans and democrats itll be a vital issue in my second term it is an issue that i am willing to take on and so ill bring republicans and democrats together and were of course going to have to consider the costs but i want to warn my fellow citizens the cost of doing nothing the cost of saying the current system is ok far exceeds the costs of trying to make sure we save the system for our children senator kerry you just heard the president say that young people ought to be able to take money out of social security and put it in their own accounts now my fellow americans thats an invitation to disaster the cbo said very clearly that if you were to adopt the presidents plan there would be a 2 trillion hole in social security because todays workers pay in to the system for todays retirees and the cbo said thats the congressional budget office its bipartisan they said that there would have to be a cut in benefits of 25 percent to 40 percent now the president has never explained to america ever hasnt done it tonight where does the transitional money that 2 trillion come from hes already got 3 trillion according to the washington post of expenses that hes put on the line from his convention and the promises of this campaign none of which are paid for not one of them are paid for the fact is that the president is driving the largest deficits in american history hes broken the payasyougo rules i have a record of fighting for fiscal responsibility in 1985 i was one of the first democrats broke with my party we balanced the budget in the 90s we paid down the debt for two years and thats what were going to do were going to protect social security i will not privatize it i will not cut the benefits and were going to be fiscally responsible and we will take care of social security let me just stay on social security with a new question for senator kerry because senator kerry you have just said you will not cut benefits alan greenspan the chairman of the federal reserve says theres no way that social security can pay retirees what we have promised them unless we recalibrate what hes suggesting were going to cut benefits or were going to have to raise the retirement age we may have to take some other reform but if youve just said youve promised no changes does that mean youre just going to leave this as a problem another problem for our children to solve not at all absolutely not bob this is the same thing we heard remember i appeared on meet the press with tim russert in 1990something we heard the same thing we fixed it in fact we put together a 5 6 trillion surplus in the 90s that was for the purpose of saving social security if you take the tax cut that the president of the united states has given president bush gave to americans in the top 1 percent of america just that tax cut that went to the top 1 percent of america would have saved social security until the year 2075 the president decided to give it to the wealthiest americans in a tax cut now alan greenspan who i think has done a terrific job in monetary policy supports the presidents tax cut i dont i support it for the middle class not that part of it that goes to people earning more than 200000 a year and when i roll it back and we invest in the things that i have talked about to move our economy were going to grow sufficiently it would begin to cut the deficit in half and we get back to where we were at the end of the 1990s when we balanced the budget and paid down the debt of this country now we can do that now if later on after a period of time we find that social security is in trouble well pull together the top experts of the country well do exactly what we did in the 1990s and well make whatever adjustment is necessary but the first and most important thing is to start creating jobs in america the jobs the president is creating pay 9000 less than the jobs that were losing and this is the first president in 72 years to preside over an economy in america that has lost jobs 1 6 million jobs eleven other presidents six democrats and five republicans had wars had recessions had great difficulties none of them lost jobs the way this president has i have a plan to put america back to work and if were fiscally responsible and put america back to work were going to fix social security mr president he forgot to tell you he voted to tax social security benefits more than one time i didnt hear any plan to fix social security i heard more of the same he talks about middleclass tax cuts thats exactly where the tax cuts went most of the tax cuts went to low and middleincome americans and now the tax code is more fair twenty percent of the upperincome people pay about 80 percent of the taxes in america today because of how we structured the tax cuts people listening out there know the benefits of the tax cuts we passed if you have a child you got tax relief if youre married you got tax relief if you pay any tax at all you got tax relief all of which was opposed by my opponent and the tax relief was important to spur consumption and investment to get us out of this recession people need to remember six months prior to my arrival the stock market started to go down and it was one of the largest declines in our history and then we had a recession and we got attacked which cost us 1 million jobs but we acted i led the congress we passed tax relief and now this economy is growing we added 1 9 million new jobs over the last 13 months sure theres more work to do but the way to make sure our economy grows is not to raise taxes on smallbusiness owners its not to increase the scope of the federal government its to make sure we have fiscal sanity and keep taxes low lets go to a new question mr president i got more email this week on this question than any other question and it is about immigration im told that at least 8000 people cross our borders illegally every day some people believe this is a security issue as you know some believe its an economic issue some see it as a humanrights issue how do you see it and what do we need to do about it i see it as a serious problem i see it as a security issue i see it as an economic issue and i see it as a humanrights issue were increasing the border security of the united states weve got 1000 more border patrol agents on the southern border were using new equipment were using unmanned vehicles to spot people coming across and well continue to do so over the next four years its a subject im very familiar with after all i was a border governor for a while many people are coming to this country for economic reasons theyre coming here to work if you can make 50 cents in the heart of mexico for example or make 5 here in america 5 15 youre going to come here if youre worth your salt if you want to put food on the table for your families and thats whats happening and so in order to take pressure off the borders in order to make the borders more secure i believe there ought to be a temporary worker card that allows a willing worker and a willing employer to mate up so long as theres not an american willing to do that job to join up in order to be able to fulfill the employers needs that has the benefit of making sure our employers arent breaking the law as they try to fill their workforce needs it makes sure that the people coming across the border are humanely treated that theyre not kept in the shadows of our society that theyre able to go back and forth to see their families see the card itll have a period of time attached to it it also means it takes pressure off the border if somebody is coming here to work with a card it means theyre not going to have to sneak across the border it means our border patrol will be more likely to be able to focus on doing their job now its very important for our citizens to also know that i dont believe we ought to have amnesty i dont think we ought to reward illegal behavior there are plenty of people standing in line to become a citizen and we ought not to crowd these people ahead of them in line if they want to become a citizen they can stand in line too and here is where my opponent and i differ in september 2003 he supported amnesty for illegal aliens times up senator let me just answer one part of the last question quickly and then ill come to immigration the american middleclass family isnt making it right now bob and what the president said about the tax cuts has been wiped out by the increase in health care the increase in gasoline the increase in tuitions the increase in prescription drugs the fact is the takehome pay of a typical american family as a share of national income is lower than its been since 1929 and the takehome pay of the richest 1 percent of americans is the highest its been since 1928 under president bush the middle class has seen their tax burden go up and the wealthiests tax burden has gone down now thats wrong now with respect to immigration reform the president broke his promise on immigration reform he said he would reform it four years later he is now promising another plan heres what ill do number one the borders are more leaking today than they were before 911 the fact is we havent done what we need to do to toughen up our borders and i will secondly we need a guestworker program but if its all we have its not going to solve the problem the second thing we need is to crack down on illegal hiring its against the law in the united states to hire people illegally and we ought to be enforcing that law properly and thirdly we need an earnedlegalization program for people who have been here for a long time stayed out of trouble got a job paid their taxes and their kids are american we got to start moving them toward full citizenship out of the shadows schieffer do you want to respond mr president well to say that the borders are not as protected as they were prior to september the 11th shows he doesnt know the borders theyre much better protected today than they were when i was the governor of texas we have much more manpower and much more equipment there he just doesnt understand how the borders work evidently to say that that is an outrageous claim and well continue to protect our borders were continuing to increase manpower and equipment senator four thousand people a day are coming across the border the fact is that we now have people from the middle east allegedly coming across the border and were not doing what we ought to do in terms of the technology we have irisidentification technology we have thumbprint fingerprint technology today we can know who the people are that theyre really the people they say they are when they cross the border we could speed it up there are huge delays the fact is our borders are not as secure as they ought to be and ill make them secure next question to you senator kerry the gap between rich and poor is growing wider more people are dropping into poverty yet the minimum wage has been stuck at what 5 15 an hour now for about seven years is it time to raise it well im glad you raised that question its long overdue time to raise the minimum wage and america this is one of those issues that separates the president and myself we have fought to try to raise the minimum wage in the last years but the republican leadership of the house and senate wont even let us have a vote on it were not allowed to vote on it they dont want to raise the minimum wage the minimum wage is the lowest minimum wage value it has been in our nation in 50 years if we raise the minimum wage which i will do over several years to 7 an hour 9 2 million women who are trying to raise their families would earn another 3800 a year the president has denied 9 2 million women 3800 a year but he doesnt hesitate to fight for 136000 to a millionaire one percent of america got 89 billion last year in a tax cut but people working hard playing by the rules trying to take care of their kids family values that were supposed to value so much in america im tired of politicians who talk about family values and dont value families what we need to do is raise the minimum wage we also need to hold on to equal pay women work for 76 cents on the dollar for the same work that men do thats not right in america and we had an initiative that we were working on to raise womens pay theyve cut it off theyve stopped it they dont enforce these kinds of things now i think that its a matter of fundamental right that if we raise the minimum wage 15 million americans would be positively affected wed put money into the hands of people who work hard who obey the rules who play for the american dream and if we did that wed have more consumption ability in america which is what we need right now in order to kick our economy into gear i will fight tooth and nail to pass the minimum wage actually mitch mcconnell had a minimumwage plan that i supported that would have increased the minimum wage but let me talk about whats really important for the worker youre referring to and thats to make sure the education system works its to make sure we raise standards listen the no child left behind act is really a jobs act when you think about it the no child left behind act says well raise standards well increase federal spending but in return for extra spending we now want people to measure states and local jurisdictions to measure to show us whether or not a child can read or write or add and subtract you cannot solve a problem unless you diagnose the problem and we werent diagnosing problems and therefore just kids were being shuffled through the school and guess who would get shuffled through children whose parents wouldnt speak english as a first language just move through many innercity kids just move through weve stopped that practice now by measuring early and when we find a problem we spend extra money to correct it i remember a lady in houston texas told me reading is the new civil right and shes right in order to make sure people have jobs for the 21st century weve got to get it right in the education system and were beginning to close a minority achievement gap now you see well never be able to compete in the 21st century unless we have an education system that doesnt quit on children an education system that raises standards an education that makes sure theres excellence in every classroom mr president i want to go back to something senator kerry said earlier tonight and ask a followup of my own he said and this will be a new question to you he said that you had never said whether you would like to overturn roe v wade so id ask you directly would you like to what hes asking me is will i have a litmus test for my judges and the answer is no i will not have a litmus test i will pick judges who will interpret the constitution but ill have no litmus test senator kerry youd like to respond is that a new question or a 30second question thats a new question for senator for president bush which time limit you have 90 seconds thank you very much well again the president didnt answer the question ill answer it straight to america im not going to appoint a judge to the court whos going to undo a constitutional right whether its the first amendment or the fifth amendment or some other right thats given under our courts today under the constitution and i believe that the right of choice is a constitutional right so i dont intend to see it undone clearly the president wants to leave in ambivalence or intends to undo it but let me go a step further we have a long distance yet to travel in terms of fairness in america i dont know how you can govern in this country when you look at new york city and you see that 50 percent of the black males there are unemployed when you see 40 percent of hispanic children of black children in some cities dropping out of high school and yet the president who talks about no child left behind refused to fully fund by 28 billion that particular program so you can make a difference in the lives of those young people now right here in arizona that difference would have been 131 million to the state of arizona to help its kids be able to have better education and to lift the property tax burden from its citizens the president reneged on his promise to fund no child left behind hell tell you hes raised the money and he has but he didnt put in what he promised and that makes a difference in the lives of our children yes sir two things one he clearly has a litmus test for his judges which i disagree with and secondly only a liberal senator from massachusetts would say that a 49 percent increase in funding for education was not enough weve increased funds but more importantly weve reformed the system to make sure that we solve problems early before theyre too late he talked about the unemployed absolutely weve got to make sure they get educated he talked about children whose parents dont speak english as a first language absolutely weve got to make sure they get educated and thats what the no child left behind act does senator you dont measure it by a percentage increase mr president you measure it by whether youre getting the job done five hundred thousand kids lost afterschool programs because of your budget now thats not in my gut thats not in my value system and certainly not so that the wealthiest people in america can walk away with another tax cut 89 billion last year to the top 1 percent of americans but kids lost their afterschool programs you be the judge all right lets go to another question and it is to senator kerry you have two minutes sir senator the last debate president bush said he did not favor a draft you agreed with him but our national guard and reserve forces are being severely strained because many of them are being held beyond their enlistments some of them say that its a backdoor draft is there any relief that could be offered to these brave americans and their families if you became president senator kerry what would you do about this situation of holding national guard and reservists for these extended periods of time and these repeated callups that theyre now facing well i think the fact that theyre facing these repeated callups some of them two and three deployments and theres a stop loss policy that prevents people from being able to get out when their time was up is a reflection of the bad judgment this president exercised in how he has engaged in the world and deployed our forces our military is overextended nine out of 10 activeduty army divisions are either in iraq going to iraq or have come back from iraq one way or the other theyre wrapped up in it now ive proposed adding two activeduty divisions to the armed forces of the united states one combat one support in addition im going to double the number of special forces so that we can fight a more effective war on terror with less pressure on the national guard and reserve and what i would like to do is see the national guard and reserve be deployed differently here in our own country theres much we can do with them with respect to homeland security we ought to be doing that and that would relieve an enormous amount of pressure but the most important thing to relieve the pressure on all of the armed forces is frankly to run a foreign policy that recognizes that america is strongest when we are working with real alliances when we are sharing the burdens of the world by working through our statesmanship at the highest levels and our diplomacy to bring other nations to our side ive said it before i say it again i believe the president broke faith to the american people in the way that he took this nation to war he said he would work through a real alliance he said in cincinnati we would plan carefully we would take every precaution well we didnt and the result is our forces today are overextended the fact is that he did not choose to go to war as a last result and america now is paying already 120 billion up to 200 billion before were finished and much more probably and that is the result of this president taking his eye off of osama bin laden mr president the best way to take the pressure off our troops is to succeed in iraq is to train iraqis so they can do the hard work of democracy is to give them a chance to defend their country which is precisely what were doing well have 125000 troops trained by the end of this year i remember going on an airplane in bangor maine to say thanks to the reservists and guard that were headed overseas from tennessee and north carolina georgia some of them had been there before the people i talked to their spirits were high they didnt view their service as a backdoor draft they viewed their service as an opportunity to serve their country my opponent the senator talks about foreign policy in our first debate he proposed america pass a global test in order to defend ourselves wed have to get international approval thats one of the major differences we have about defending our country ill work with allies ill work with friends well continue to build strong coalitions but i will never turn over our national security decisions to leaders of other countries well be resolute well be strong and well wage a comprehensive war against the terrorists senator i have never suggested a test where we turn over our security to any nation in fact ive said the opposite i will never turn the security of the united states over to any nation no nation will ever have a veto over us but i think it makes sense i think most americans in their guts know that we ought to pass a sort of truth standard thats how you gain legitimacy with your own countrypeople and thats how you gain legitimacy in the world but ill never fail to protect the united states of america in 1990 there was a vast coalition put together to run saddam hussein out of kuwait the international community the international world said this is the right thing to do but when it came time to authorize the use of force on the senate floor my opponent voted against the use of force apparently you cant pass any test under his vision of the world mr president new question two minutes you said that if congress would vote to extend the ban on assault weapons that youd sign the legislation but you did nothing to encourage the congress to extend it why not actually i made my intentions made my views clear i did think we ought to extend the assault weapons ban and was told the fact that the bill was never going to move because republicans and democrats were against the assault weapon ban people of both parties i believe lawabiding citizens ought to be able to own a gun i believe in background checks at gun shows or anywhere to make sure that guns dont get in the hands of people that shouldnt have them but the best way to protect our citizens from guns is to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns and thats why early in my administration i called the attorney general and the u s attorneys and said put together a task force all around the country to prosecute those who commit crimes with guns and the prosecutions are up by about 68 percent i believe is the number neighborhoods are safer when we crack down on people who commit crimes with guns to me thats the best way to secure america senator i believe it was a failure of presidential leadership not to reauthorize the assault weapons ban i am a hunter im a gun owner ive been a hunter since i was a kid 12 13 years old and i respect the second amendment and i will not tamper with the second amendment but ill tell you this im also a former law enforcement officer i ran one of the largest district attorneys offices in america one of the ten largest i put people behind bars for the rest of their life ive broken up organized crime i know something about prosecuting and most of the law enforcement agencies in america wanted that assault weapons ban they dont want to go into a drug bust and be facing an ak47 i was hunting in iowa last year with a sheriff from one of the counties there and he pointed to a house in back of us and said see the house over we just did a drug bust a week earlier and the guy we arrested had an ak47 lying on the bed right beside him because of the presidents decision today law enforcement officers will walk into a place that will be more dangerous terrorists can now come into america and go to a gun show and without even a background check buy an assault weapon today and thats what osama bin ladens handbook said because we captured it in afghanistan it encouraged them to do it so i believe americas less safe if tom delay or someone in the house said to me sorry we dont have the votes id have said then were going to have a fight and id have taken it out to the country and id have had every law enforcement officer in the country visit those congressmen wed have won what bill clinton won lets go to a new question for you senator kerry two minutes affirmative action do you see a need for affirmative action programs or have we moved far enough along that we no longer need to use race and gender as a factor in school admissions and federal and state contracts and so on no bob regrettably we have not moved far enough along and i regret to say that this administration has even blocked steps that could help us move further along ill give you an example i served on the small business committee for a long time i was chairman of it once now im the senior democrat on it we used to you know we have a goal there for minority setaside programs to try to encourage ownership in the country they dont reach those goals they dont even fight to reach those goals theyve tried to undo them the fact is that in too many parts of our country we still have discrimination and affirmative action is not just something that applies to people of color some people have a mistaken view of it in america it also is with respect to women its with respect to other efforts to try to reach out and be inclusive in our country i think that we have a long way to go regrettably if you look at whats happened weve made progress i want to say that at the same time during the clinton years as you may recall there was a fight over affirmative action and there were many people like myself who opposed quotas who felt there were places where it was overreaching so we had a policy called mend it dont end it we fixed it and we fixed it for a reason because there are too many people still in this country who feel the stark resistance of racism and so we have a distance to travel as president i will make certain we travel it now let me just share something this president is the first president ever i think not to meet with the naacp this is a president who hasnt met with the black congressional caucus this is a president who has not met with the civil rights leadership of our country if a president doesnt reach out and bring people in and be inclusive then how are we going to get over those barriers i see that as part of my job as president and ill make my best effort to do it mr president well first of all it is just not true that i havent met with the black congressional caucus i met with the black congressional caucus at the white house and secondly like my opponent i dont agree we ought to have quotas i agree we shouldnt have quotas but we ought to have an aggressive effort to make sure people are educated to make sure when they get out of high school theres pell grants available for them which is what weve done weve expanded pell grants by a million students do you realize today in america we spend 73 billion to help 10 million low and middleincome families better afford college thats the access i believe is necessary is to make sure every child learns to read write add and subtract early to be able to build on that education by going to college so they can start their careers with a college diploma i believe the best way to help our small businesses is not only through smallbusiness loans which we have increased since ive been the president of the united states but to unbundle government contracts so people have a chance to be able to bid and receive a contract to help get their business going minority ownership of businesses are up because we created an environment for the entrepreneurial spirit to be strong i believe part of a hopeful society is one in which somebody owns something today in america more minorities own a home than ever before and thats hopeful and thats positive mr president lets go to a new question you were asked before the invasion or after the invasion of iraq if youd checked with your dad and i believe i dont remember the quote exactly but i believe you said you had checked with a higher authority i would like to ask you what part does your faith play on your policy decisions first my faith plays a lot a big part in my life and thats when i was answering that question what i was really saying to the person was that i pray a lot and i do and my faith is a very its very personal i pray for strength i pray for wisdom i pray for our troops in harms way i pray for my family i pray for my little girls but im mindful in a free society that people can worship if they want to or not youre equally an american if you choose to worship an almighty and if you choose not to if youre a christian jew or muslim youre equally an american thats the great thing about america is the right to worship the way you see fit prayer and religion sustain me i receive calmness in the storms of the presidency i love the fact that people pray for me and my family all around the country somebody asked me one time well how do you know i said i just feel it religion is an important part i never want to impose my religion on anybody else but when i make decisions i stand on principle and the principles are derived from who i am i believe we ought to love our neighbor like we love ourself as manifested in public policy through the faithbased initiative where weve unleashed the armies of compassion to help heal people who hurt i believe that god wants everybody to be free thats what i believe and thats been part of my foreign policy in afghanistan i believe that the freedom there is a gift from the almighty and i cant tell you how encouraged i am to see freedom on the march and so my principles that i make decisions on are a part of me and religion is a part of me senator kerry well i respect everything that the president has said and certainly respect his faith i think its important and i share it i think that he just said that freedom is a gift from the almighty everything is a gift from the almighty and as i measure the words of the bible and we all do different people measure different things the koran the torah or you know native americans who gave me a blessing the other day had their own special sense of connectedness to a higher being and people all find their ways to express it i was taught i went to a church school and i was taught that the two greatest commandments are love the lord your god with all your mind your body and your soul and love your neighbor as yourself and frankly i think we have a lot more loving of our neighbor to do in this country and on this planet we have a separate and unequal school system in the united states of america theres one for the people who have and theres one for the people who dont have and were struggling with that today and the president and i have a difference of opinion about how we live out our sense of our faith i talked about it earlier when i talked about the works and faith without works being dead i think weve got a lot more work to do and as president i will always respect everybodys right to practice religion as they choose or not to practice because thats part of america senator kerry after 911 and this is a new question for you it seemed to me that the country came together as ive never seen it come together since world war ii but some of that seems to have melted away i think its fair to say weve become pretty polarized perhaps because of the political season but if you were elected president or whoever is elected president will you set a priority in trying to bring the nation back together or what would be your attitude on that very much so let me pay a compliment to the president if i may i think in those days after 911 i thought the president did a terrific job and i really was moved as well as impressed by the speech that he gave to the congress and i think the hug tom daschle gave him at that moment was about as genuine a sense of there being no democrats no republicans we were all just americans thats where we were thats not where we are today i regret to say that the president who called himself a uniter not a divider is now presiding over the most divided america in the recent memory of our country ive never seen such ideological squabbles in the congress of the united states ive never seen members of a party locked out of meetings the way theyre locked out today we have to change that and as president i am committed to changing that i dont care if the idea comes from the other side or this side i think we have to come together and work to change it and ive done that over 20 years in the united states senate ive worked with john mccain whos sitting here ive worked with other colleagues ive reached across the aisle ive tried to find the common ground because thats what makes us strong as americans and if americans trust me with the presidency i can pledge to you we will have the most significant effort openly not secret meetings in the white house with special interests not ideologically driven efforts to push people aside but a genuine effort to try to restore americas hope and possibilities by bringing people together and one of the ways were going to do it is im going to work with my friend john mccain to further campaign finance reform so we get these incredible amounts of money out of the system and open it up to average people so america is really represented by the people who make up america mr president my biggest disappointment in washington is how partisan the town is i had a record of working with republicans and democrats as the governor of texas and i was hopeful id be able to do the same thing and we made good progress early on the no child left behind act incredibly enough was good work between me and my administration and people like senator ted kennedy and we worked together with democrats to relieve the tax burden on the middle class and all who pay taxes in order to make sure this economy continues to grow but washington is a tough town and the way i view it is theres a lot of entrenched special interests there people who are you know on one side of the issue or another and they spend enormous sums of money and they convince different senators to taut their way or different congressmen to talk about their issue and they dig in ill continue in the four years to continue to try to work to do so my opponent said this is a bitterly divided time pretty divided in the 2000 election so in other words its pretty divided during the 1990s as well were just in a period weve got to work to bring it my opponent keeps mentioning john mccain and im glad he did john mccain is for me for president because he understands i have the right view in winning the war on terror and that my plan will succeed in iraq and my opponent has got a plan of retreat and defeat in iraq weve come gentlemen to our last question and it occurred to me as i came to this debate tonight that the three of us share something all three of us are surrounded by very strong women were all married to strong women each of us have two daughters that make us very proud id like to ask each of you what is the most important thing youve learned from these strong women to listen to them to stand up straight and not scowl i love the strong women around me i cant tell you how much i love my wife and our daughters i am you know its really interesting i tell the people on the campaign trail when i asked laura to marry me she said fine just so long as i never have to give a speech i said ok youve got a deal fortunately she didnt hold me to that deal and shes out campaigning along with our girls and she speaks english a lot better than i do i think people understand what shes saying but they see a compassionate strong great first lady in laura bush i cant tell you how lucky i am when i met her in the backyard at joe and jan oneills in midland texas it was the classic backyard barbecue oneill said come on over i think youll find somebody who might interest you so i said all right bopped over there there was only four of us there and not only did she interest me i guess you would say it was love at first sight senator kerry well i guess the president and you and i are three examples of lucky people who married up and some would say maybe me more so than others but i can take it can i say if i could just say a word about a woman that you didnt ask about but my mom passed away a couple years ago just before i was deciding to run and she was in the hospital and i went in to talk to her and tell her what i was thinking of doing and she looked at me from her hospital bed and she just looked at me and she said remember integrity integrity integrity those are the three words that she left me with and my daughters and my wife are people who just are filled with that sense of whats right whats wrong they also kick me around they keep me honest they dont let me get away with anything i can sometimes take myself too seriously they surely dont let me do that and im blessed as i think the president is blessed as i said last time ive watched him with the first lady who i admire a great deal and his daughters hes a great father and i think were both very lucky well gentlemen that brings us to the closing statements senator kerry i believe youre first my fellow americans as you heard from bob schieffer a moment ago america is being tested by division more than ever we need to be united as a country and like franklin roosevelt i dont care whether an idea is a republican idea or a democrat idea i just care whether it works for america and whether its going to make us stronger these are dangerous times i believe i offer tested strong leadership that can calm the waters of the troubled world and i believe that we can together do things that are within the grasp of americans we can lift our schools up we can create jobs that pay more than the jobs were losing overseas we can have health care for all americans we can further the cause of equality in our nation let me just make it clear i will never allow any country to have a veto over our security just as i fought for our country as a young man with the same passion i will fight to defend this nation that i love and with faith in god and with conviction in the mission of america i believe that we can reach higher i believe we can do better i think the greatest possibilities of our country our dreams and our hopes are out there just waiting for us to grab onto them and i ask you to embark on that journey with me i ask you for your trust i ask you for your help i ask you to allow me the privilege of leading this great nation of ours of helping us to be stronger here at home and to be respected again in the world and most of all to be safer forever thank you goodnight and god bless the united states of america mr president in the oval office theres a painting by a friend of laura and mine named by tom lee and its a west texas painting a painting of a mountain scene and he said this about it he said sarah and i live on the east side of the mountain its the sunrise side not the sunset side its the side to see the day that is coming not to see the day that is gone i love the optimism in that painting because thats how i feel about america and weve been through a lot together during the last 3 34 years weve come through a recession a stock market decline an attack on our country and yet because of the hard work of the american people and good policies this economy is growing over the next four years well make sure the economy continues to grow we reformed our school system and now theres an achievement gap in america thats beginning to close over the next four years well continue to insist on excellence in every classroom in america so that our children have a chance to realize the great promise of america over the next four years well continue to work to make sure health care is available and affordable over the next four years well continue to rally the armies of compassion to help heal the hurt that exists in some of our countrys neighborhoods im optimistic that well win the war on terror but i understand it requires firm resolve and clear purpose we must never waver in the face of this enemy that these ideologues of hate and as we pursue the enemy wherever it exists well also spread freedom and liberty we got great faith in the ability of liberty to transform societies to convert a hostile world to a peaceful world my hope for america is a prosperous america a hopeful america and a safer world i want to thank you for listening tonight im asking for your vote god bless you thank you mr president thank you senator kerry well that brings these debates to a close but the campaign goes on i want to wish both of you the very best of luck between now and election day thats it for us from arizona state university in tempe arizona im bob schieffer at cbs news goodnight everyone 
 so i guess this is more or less now just to get you up to date johno this is what uh this is a meeting for me um eva bhaskara and i did did you add more stuff to it later um why um i dont know there were like the you know and all that stuff but i thought you you said you were adding stuff but i dont know uh no this is um ha very nice um so we thought that we can write up uh an element and for each of the situation nodes that we observed in the bayesnet so whats the situation like at the entity that is mentioned if we know anything about it is it under construction or is it on fire or something happening to it or is it stable and so forth going all the way um f through parking location hotel car restroom riots fairs strikes or disasters so is this is a situation are is all the things which can be happening right now or what is the situation type thats basically just specifying the the input for the w whats oh i see y why are you specifying it in xml um just because it forces us to be specific about the values here ok and also i mean this is a what the input is going to be right so we will uh this is a schema this is well yeah i just dont know if this is th l what the does this is what java bayes takes as a no because i mean if we bayesnet spec i mean were sure gonna interface to were gonna get an xml document from somewhere right and that xml document will say we are able to we were able to observe that w the element um of the location that the car is near so thats gonna be um so this is the situational context everything in it is that what situation is short for shi situational context yep ok so this is just again a an xml schemata which defines a set of possible uh permissible xml structures which we view as input into the bayesnet right and then we can r uh possibly run one of them uh transformations that put it into the format that the bayes n or java bayes or whatever wants yea are you talking are you talking about the the structure well it i mean when you observe a node when you when you say the input to the v java bayes umhmm it takes a certain format right which i dont think is this although i dont know no its certainly not this nuh so you could just couldnt you just run a xsl yeah yeah to convert it into the java bayes for format yep ok thats thats no problem but i even think that um i mean once once you have this sort of as running as a module right what you want is you wanna say ok give me the posterior probabilities of the gothere node when this is happening right when the person said this the car is there its raining and this is happening and with this you can specify the whats happening in the situation and whats happening with the user so we get after we are done through the situation we get the user vector so this is a so this is just a specification of all the possible inputs yep and all the possible outputs too ok so we have um for example the uh gothere decision node which has two elements goingthere and its posterior probability and notgoingthere and its posterior probability because the output is always gonna be all the decision nodes and all the the a all the posterior probabilities for all the values and then we would just look at the eh struct that we wanna look at in terms of if if were only asking about one of the so like if im just interested in the goingthere node i would just pull that information out of the struct that gets return that would that java bayes would output um pretty much yes but i think its a little bit more complex as if i understand it correctly it always gives you all the posterior probabilities for all the values of all decision nodes so when we input something we always get the uh posterior probabilities for all of these right ok so there is no way of telling it t not to tell us about the eva values yeah wait i agree thats yeah use oh uh yeah ok so so we get this whole list of of um things and the question is what to do with it what to hand on how to interpret it in a sense so y you said if you im only interested in whether he wants to go there or not then i just look at that node look which one look at that struct in the output right yep look at that struct in the the output even though i wouldnt call it a struct but well i well its an xml structure thats being res returned right oh mmhmm so every part of a structure is a struct yeah yeah i just uh i just was abbreviated it to struct in my head and started going with that that element or object i would say not a cstruct thats not what i was trying to k though yeah yeah ok and um the reason is why i think its a little bit more complex or why why we can even think about it as an interesting problem in and of itself is um so the uh lets look at an example well w wouldnt we just take the structure thats outputted and then run another transformation on it that would just dump the one that we wanted out yeah w wed need to prune right throw things away well actually you dont even need to do that with xml d cant you just look at one specific no yeah exactly the xerxes allows you to say u just give me the value of that and that and that but we dont really know what were interested in before we look at the complete at at the overall result so the person said um where is x and so we want to know um is does he want info o on this or know the location or does he want to go there lets assume this is our our question sure nuh so um do this in perl so we get ok lets assume this is the output so we should con be able to conclude from that that i mean its always gonna give us a value of how likely we think i it is that he wants to go there and doesnt want to go there or how likely it is that he wants to get information but maybe w we should just reverse this to make it a little bit more delicate so does he wanna know where it is or does he wanna go there he wants to know where it is right i i i tend to agree and if its if well now y i mean you could and i if theres sort of a clear winner here and um and this is pretty uh indifferent then we then we might conclude that he actually wants to just know where uh t uh he does want to go there uh out of curiosity is there a reason why we wouldnt combine these three nodes into one smaller subnet that would just basically be the question for we have where is x is the question right that would just be infoon or location based upon or gothere a lot of people ask that if they actually just wanna go there people come up to you on campus and say wheres the library youre gonna say y youre gonna say g go down that way youre not gonna say its its five hundred yards away from you or its north of you or its located well i mean but the theres so you just have three decisions for the final node that would link thes these three nodes in the net together um i dont know whether i understand what you mean but again in this given this input we also in some situations may wanna postulate an opinion whether that person wants to go there now the nicest way use a cab or so s wants to know it wants to know where it is because he wants something fixed there because he wants to visit t it or whatever so it n i mean a all im saying is whatever our input is were always gonna get the full output and some some things will always be sort of too not significant enough wha or i or i itll be tight you wont itll be hard to decide but i mean i guess i guess the thing is yep uh this is another smaller case of reasoning in the case of an uncertainty which makes me think bayesnet should be the way to solve these things so if you had if for every construction right oh you could say well there heres the whereis construction and for the whereis construction we know we need to l look at this node that merges these three things together mmhmm as for th to decide the response and since we have a finite number of constructions that we can deal with we could have a finite number of nodes ok say if we had to y deal with arbitrary language it wouldnt make any sense to do that because mmhmm thered be no way to generate the nodes for every possible sentence mmhmm but since we can only deal with a finite amount of stuff so basically the idea is to f to feed the output of that beliefnet into another beliefnet yeah so basically take these three things and then put them into another beliefnet but why why why only those three why not the whol well i mean d for the whereis question so wed have a node for the whereis question yeah but we believe that all the decision nodes are can be relevant for the whereis and the where howdoigetto or the tellmesomethingabout is food not allowed in here you can come in if you want yes it is allowed as long as y youre not wearing your h your h headphones alright just a second ill be back well i do i see i dont know if this is a good idea or not im just throwing it out but uh it seems like we could have i mea or uh we could put all of the all of the r information that could also be relevant into the whereis node answer mmhmm yep node thing stuff and uh ok i mean lets not forget were gonna get some very strong input from these sub dis from these discourse things right so tell me the location of x nuh or where is x located we u at nuh yeah i know but the bayesnet would be able to the weights on the on the nodes in the bayesnet would be able to do all that wouldnt it mmhmm heres a k oh oh ill wait until youre plugged in oh dont sit there sit here you know how you dont like that one its ok oh do i not thats the weird one thats the one thats painful that hurts it hurts so bad im h im happy that theyre recording that that headphone the headphone that you have to put on backwards with the little little thing and the little little foam block on it its a painful painful microphone i think its th called the crown the crown what yeah versus the sony the crown is that the actual name mmhmm ok the manufacturer i dont see a manufacturer on it you w oh wait here it is h this thingy yeah its the crown the crown of pain yes youre online are you are your mike o is your mike on ok indeed so youve been working with these guys you know whats going on yes i have and i do yeah alright s so where are we excellent were discussing this i dont think it can handle french but anyway so assume we have something coming in a person says where is x and we get a certain we have a situation vector and a user vector and everything is fine an an and and our and our did you just sti did you just stick the m the the the microphone actually in the tea no and um im not drinking tea what are you talking about oh yeah sorry lets just assume our bayesnet just has three decision nodes for the time being these three he wants to know something about it he wants to know where it is he wants to go there in terms of these would be wha how we would answer the question whereis right we u this is i thats what you s it seemed like explained it to me earlier w we were we wanna know how to answer the question where is x yeah but mmm yeah no i can i can do the timing node in here too and say ok well yeah but in the s uh lets just deal with the s the simple case of were not worrying about timing or anything we just want to know how we should answer where is x ok and um ok and gothere has two values right gothere and notgothere lets assume those are the posterior probabilities of that mmhmm infoon has true or false and location so he wants to know something about it and he wants to know something he wants to know whereitis excuse me has these values and um oh i see why we cant do that and um in this case we would probably all agree that he wants to go there our beliefnet thinks he wants to go there right in the uh whatever if we have something like yeah mmhmm this here and this like that and maybe here also some you should probably make them out of yeah well it something like that then we would guess aha he our beliefnet has s stronger beliefs that he wants to know where it is than actually wants to go there right that it doesnt this assume though that theyre evenly weighted true like i guess they are evenly weighted the different decision nodes you mean yeah the gothere the infoon and the location well d yeah this is making the assumption yes like what do you mean by differently weighted they dont feed into anything really anymore or i jus but i mean why do we le if we trusted the gothere node more th much more than we trusted the other ones then we would conclude even in this situation that he wanted to go there so in that sense we weight them equally ok makes sense yeah right now so the but i guess the k the question but that i was as er wondering or maybe robert was proposing to me is how do we d make the decision on as to which one to listen to yeah so the final d decision is the combination of these three so again its its some kind of uh bayesnet yeah sure ok so then the question i so then my question is t to you then would be so is the only r reason we can make all these smaller bayesnets because we know we can only deal with a finite set of constructions cuz oth if were just taking arbitrary language in we couldnt have a node for every possible question you know a decision node for every possible question you mean well i like in the case of yeah in the ca any piece of language we wouldnt be able to answer it with this system b if we just h cuz we wouldnt have the correct node basically w what youre s proposing is a n whereis node right yeah and and if we and if someone says you know uh something in mandarin so is yeah to the system wed wouldnt know which node to look at to answer that question right yeah mmm so but but if we have a finite what i dont see your point what what what i am thinking or what were about to propose here is were always gonna get the whole list of values and their posterior probabilities and now we need an expert system or beliefnet or something that interprets that that looks at all the values and says the winner is timing now go there uh go there timing now or the winner is infoon functionoff so he wants to know something about it and what it does nuh uh regardless of of of the input wh regardle yeah but but how does the expert but how does the expert system know how who which one to declare the winner if it doesnt know the question it is and how that question should be answered based on the k what the question was so what the discourse the ontology the situation and the user model gave us we came up with these values for these decisions yeah i know but how do we weight what we get out as which one i which ones are important so my i so if we were to it with a bayesnet wed have to have a node for every question that we knew how to deal with that would take all of the inputs and weight them appropriately for that question mmhmm does that make sense yay nay um i mean are you saying that what happens if you try to scale this up to the situation or are we just dealing with arbitrary language we is that your point well no i i guess my question is is the reason that we can make a node f or ok so lemme see if im confused are we going to make a node for every question does that make sense or not for every question like every construction hmm i dont not necessarily i would think i mean its not based on constructions its based on things like uh theres gonna be a node for gothere or not and theres gonna be a node for enter view approach wel w ok so someone asked a question yeah how do we decide how to answer it well look at look face yourself with this pr question you get this youll have y this is what you get and now you have to make a decision what do we think what does this tell us and not knowing what was asked and what happened and whether the person was a tourist or a local because all of these factors have presumably already gone into making these posterior probabilities yeah what what we need is a just a mechanism that says aha there is i just dont think a winnertakeall type of thing is the i mean in general like we wont just have those three right well have uh like many many nodes yep so we have to like so that its no longer possible to just look at the nodes themselves and figure out what the person is trying to say because there are interdependencies right the uh uh no so if if for example the gothere posterior possibility is so high um uh w if its if it has reached reached a certain height then all of this becomes irrelevant so if even if if the function or the history or something is scoring pretty good on the true node true value wel i dont know about that cuz that would suggest that i mean he wants to go there and know something about it do they have to be mutual yeah do they have to be mutually exclusive i think to some extent they are or maybe theyre not cuz i uh the way you describe what they meant they werent mutu uh they didnt seem mutually exclusive to me well if he doesnt want to go there even if the enter posterior proba so wel gothere is no enter is high and infoon is high well yeah just out of the other three though that you had in the hmm those three nodes the d they didnt seem like they were mutually exclusive no theres no but its through the so th s so yeah but some so some things would drop out and some things would still be important mmhmm but i guess whats confusing me is if we have a bayesnet to deal w another bayesnet to deal with this stuff mmhmm you know uh is the only reason ok so i guess if we have a ba another bayesnet to deal with this stuff the only r reason we can design it is cuz we know what each question is asking yeah i think thats true and then so the only reason way we would know what question hes asking is based upon oh so if lets say i had a construction parser and i plug this in i would know what each construction the communicative intent of the construction was mmhmm and so then i would know how to weight the nodes appropriately in response so no matter what they said if i could map it onto a whereis construction ge mmhmm i could say ah well the the intent here was whereis ok right and i could look at those yeah yes i mean sure you do need to know i mean to have that kind of information hmm yeah im also agreeing that a simple pru take the ones where we have a clear winner forget about the ones where its all sort of middle ground prune those out and just hand over the ones where we have a winner yeah because that would be the easiest way we just compose as an output an xml mes message that says go there now enter historical information and not care whether thats consistent with anything right but in this case if we say definitely he doesnt want to go there he just wants to know where it is or lets call this this lookath he wants to know something about the history of so he said tell me something about the history of that now the e but for some reason the endpointapproach gets a really high score too we cant expect this to be sort of at o point three three three o point three three three o point three three three right somebody needs to zap that you know or know there needs to be some knowledge that we yeah but the bayesnet that would merge i just realized that i had my hand in between my mouth and my micr er my and my microphone so then the bayesnet that would merge there that would make the decision between gothere infoon and location would have a node to tell you which one of those three you wanted and based upon that node then you would look at the other stuff yep i mean it i yep does that make sense yep its sort of one of those thats its more like a decision tree if if you want you first look o at the lowball ones and then yeah i yeah i didnt intend to say that every possible ok there was a confusion there k i didnt intend to say every possible thing should go into the bayesnet because some of the things arent relevant in the bayesnet for a specific question like the endpoint is not necessarily relevant in the bayesnet for whereis until after youve decided whether you wanna go there or not mmhmm right show us the way bhaskara i guess the other thing is that um yeah i mean when youre asked a specific question and you dont even like if youre asked a whereis question you may not even look like ask for the posterior probability of the uh eva node right cuz thats what i mean in the bayesnet you always ask for the posterior probability of a specific node so i mean you may not even bother to compute things you dont need um arent we always computing all no you can compute uh the posterior probability of one subset of the nodes given some other nodes but totally ignore some other nodes also basically things you ignore get marginalized over yeah but thats thats just shifting the problem then you would have to make a decision ok if its a whereis question which yeah so you have to make yeah decision nodes do i query yes thats un but i would think thats what you want to do right mmm well eventually you still have to pick out which ones you look at so its pretty much the same problem isnt it yeah yeah its its its apples and oranges nuh i mean maybe it does make a difference in terms of performance computational time so either you mmhmm always have it compute all the posterior possibilities for all the values for all nodes and then prune mmm the ones you think that are irrelevant or you just make a p a priori estimate of what you think might be relevant and query those yeah so basically youd have a decision tree query gothere if k if thats false query this one if thats true query that one and just basically do a binary search through the i dont know if it would necessarily be that uh complicated but uh i mean it w well in the case of gothere it would be in the case cuz if you needed an if y if gothere was true youd wanna know what endpoint was and if it was false youd wanna d look at either lo income infoon or history yeah thats true i guess yeah so in a way you would have that also im somewhat boggled by that hugin software ok whys that i cant figure out how to get the probabilities into it like id look at mmhmm its somewha its boggling me ok alright well hopefully its fixable ju oh yeah yeah i d i just think i havent its theres a figured out what the terms in hugin mean versus what java bayes terms are ok um by the way are do we know whether jerry and nancy are coming or so we can figure this out they should come when theyre done their stuff basically whenever that is so what d what do they need to do left um i guess jerry needs to enter marks but i dont know if hes gonna do that now or later but uh if hes gonna enter marks its gonna take him awhile i guess and he wont be here and whats nancy doing nancy um she was sorta finishing up the uh calculation of marks and assigning of grades but i dont know if she should be here well or she should be free after that so assuming shes coming to this meeting i dont know if she knows about it shes on the email list right is she ok mmhmm ok because basically what where we also have decided prior to this meeting is that we would have a rerun of the three of us sitting together ok sometime this week again ok and finish up the uh values of this so we have uh believe it or not we have all the bottom ones here well i you added a bunch of nodes for yep ok we we we have actually what we have is this line uh what do the uh right structures hmm do so the the the for instance this location nodes got two inputs that one you four inputs hmm four those are the bottom things are inputs also oh i see yeah ok that was ok that makes a lot more sense to me now yep cuz i thought it was like that one in stuarts book about you know the alarm in the dog u yeah yeah or the earthquake and the alarm sorry yeah im confusing two yeah theres a dog one too but thats in java bayes isnt it right maybe but theres something about bowel problems or something with the dog yeah and we have all the top ones all the ones to which no arrows are pointing what were missing are the these where arrows are pointing where were combining top ones so we have to come up with values for this and this this this and so forth and maybe just fiddle around with it a little bit more and um and then its just uh edges many of edges and um we wont meet next monday so cuz of memorial day yep well meet next tuesday i guess yeah whens jerry leaving for italia on on friday which friday this this friday ok oh this friday ugh this friday as in four days yep or three days is he how long is he gone for two weeks italy huh whats uh whats there well its a country buildings people but its not a conference or anything hes just visiting pasta hmm right just visiting vacation its a pretty nice place in my brief uh encounter with it do you guys oh yeah so part of what we actually want to do is sort of schedule out what we want to surprise him with when when he comes back um so oh i think we should disappoint him yeah you or have a finished construction parser and a working beliefnet and uh that wouldnt be disappointing i think w we should do absolutely no work for the two weeks that hes gone well thats actually what i had planned personally i had i i had sort of scheduled out in my mind that you guys do a lot of work and i do nothing and then i sort of oh yeah that sounds good too sort of bask in in your glory but uh i do you guys have any vacation plans because i myself am going to be um gone but this is actually not really important just this weekend were going camping yeah im wanna be this gone this weekend too ah but were all going to be here on tuesday again looks like it yeah ok then lets meet meet again next tuesday and um finish up this bayesnet and once we have finished it i guess we can um and thats going to be more just you and me because bhaskara is doing probabilistic recursive structured objectoriented uh killing machines reasoning machines yes and um killing reasoning whats the difference wait so youre saying next tuesday is it the whole group meeting or just uh us three working on it or or the whole group and we present our results our final ok definite so when you were saying we need to do a rerun of like h what what like just working out the rest of the yeah we should do this th the upcoming days this week so this week yeah ok when you say the whole group you mean the four of us and keith and ami might ami might be here and its possible that nancyll be here yep so yeah because th you know once we have the beliefnet done youre just gonna have to explain it to me then on tuesday how its all gonna work out you know we will ok because then once we have it sort of up and running then we can start you know defining the interfaces and then feed stuff into it and get stuff out of it and then hook it up to some fake construction parser and that you will have in about nine months or so yeah yeah and um the first bad versionll be done in nine months yeah i can worry about the ontology interface and you can keith can worry about the discourse i mean this is pretty um i mean i i i hope everybody uh knows that these are just going to be uh dummy values right which where the which ones s so so if the endpoint if the gothere is yes and no then gothere discourse will just be fiftyfifty right um what do you mean if the gothere says no then the gothere is i dont get it i dont u understand um like the gothere depends on all those four things yep yeah but what are the values of the gothere discourse well it depends on the situation if the discourse is strongly indicating that yeah but uh we have no discourse input oh i see the d see uh specifically in our situation d and o are gonna be uh yeah sure so whatever so so far we have is that what the keith node is yep ok and youre taking it out for now or well this is d ok this i can i can get it in here all the d s are i can get it in here so th we have the uh um sk lets lets call it keithjohno node johno there is an h somewhere printed there you go yeah people have the same problem with my name yeah oops and um does th th does the h go b before the a or after the a oh in my name before the a yeah ok good cuz you kn when you said people have the same problem i thought cuz my h goes after the uh e e e the v people have the inverse problem with my name ok i always have to check every time y i send you an email a past email of yours to make sure im spelling your name correctly yeah thats good i worry about you i appreciate that but when you abbreviate yourself as the basman you dont use any hs basman yeah its because of the chessplayer named michael basman who is my hero ok youre a geek its o k i how do you pronou ok how do you pronounce your name eva eva yeah not eva what if i were what if i were to call you eva id probably still respond to it ive had people call me eva but i dont know no not just eva eva like if i u take the v and s pronounce it like it was a german v which is f yeah um no idea then voiced what it sounds like an f theres also an f in german which is why i i ok well its just the difference between voiced and unvoiced ok yeah as long as thats o k i mean i might slip out and say it accidentally thats all im saying um thats fine yeah it doesnt matter what those nodes are anyway because well just make the weights zero for now yep well make them zero for now because it who who knows what they come up with whats gonna come in there ok and um then should we start on thursday ok and not meet tomorrow sure ok ill send an email make a time suggestion wait maybe its ok so that that that we can that we have one node per construction cuz even in people like they dont know what youre talking about if youre using some sort of strange construction yeah they would still c sort of get the closest best fit well yeah but i mean the uh i mean thats what the construction parser would do uh i mean if you said something completely arbitrary it would f find the mmhmm closest construction right but if you said something that was completel er h theoretically the construction parser would do that ok but if you said something for which there was no construction whatsoever n people wouldnt have any idea what you were talking about mmhmm like bus dog fried egg i mean you know or if even something chinese for example or something in mandarin yeah or cantonese as the case may be what do you think about that bhaskara i mean well but how many constructions do could we possibly have nodes for in this system or in r no we like when people do this kind of thing oh when p how many constructions do people have yeah i have not the slightest idea is it considered to be like in are they considered to be like very uh sort of s abstract things every noun is a construction ok so its like in the thousands the yeah any any form meaning pair to my understanding is a construction ok so and form u starts at the level of noun or actually maybe even sounds yeah phoneme yep and goes upwards until you get the ditransitive construction and then of course the c i guess maybe there can be the s can there be combinations of the dit discourselevel yeah constructions the giving a speech construction rhetorical constructions yeah yes but i mean you know you can probably count count the ways i mean its probab yeah i would s definitely say its finite yeah and at least in compilers thats all that really matters as long as your analysis is finite hows that how it can be finite again nah i cant think of a way it would be infinite well you can come up with new constructions yeah if the if your if your brain was totally nondeterministic then perhaps theres a way to get uh infin an infinite number of constructions that youd have to worry about but i mean in the practical sense its impossible right cuz if we have a fixed number of neurons yeah so the bestcase scenario would be the number of constructions or the worstcase scenario is the number of constructions equals the number of neurons well two to the power of the number of neurons right but still finite ok no wait not necessarily is it we can end the meeting i just cant you use different var different levels of activation across uh mmhmm lots of different neurons to specify different values um yeah but theres like a certain level of theres a bandwidth issue right yeah bandw yeah so you cant do better than something turn off the mikes otherwise it gets really tough for the tr 
 if youre popular one two three four five six im on seven were on its probably the pzms yeah so i think we precrashed so i think were ok precrashed so it should be a really short meeting i hope uh agenda items number one i wanna talk since we were just discussing that is microphone issues what the heck are we gonna do about microphones so uh i got passed on that the edu group doesnt like the oh uh crown mikes i do i l i think i find them very comfortable uh but it seems to depend on your head shape who does i do yeah i do too so you guys need to start going to the edu meetings i see yeah right they dont work for me very well i much prefer these thats right yep um yeah me too so do i i prefer these but i dont mind using those right th those are intimidating so apparently they they like it has one good effect that people are trying to get there early because the people who get there early get to pick the mike ok interesting people who show up late have to use these so um we should probably get different mikes so the question is the easiest thing to do is certainly to just get two more um sony mikes just two more of those um and that thats easy and that will certainly work the other option is to try yet another mike find one we like and potentially get six all the same i have a question about this are the auditory quality is it uh much different between this kind and the the fancy ones um these are better if theyre worn correctly they are ok those are better than the sonys have you yeah yeah definitely have you listened to to them yeah yeah yeah ok so i mean theyre not a lot better but they are a little better are they more directional the microphones as far as um theyre more directional a little better error uh noise cancellation and also you can really get it right in front of your mouth like this whereas that one to avoid breath noise you really have to put it at to the side ok so you seem to get better signal with this one the other thing is is it just a few people who dont like them in the edu group cuz i dont know but you know in in sort of random polling l liz liz said something that leaves me believing that nobody likes them they are ver gosh cuz i much prefer them i think theyre a whole lot multiple levels better it seems a shame t to discard discard them if if theyre better auditory quality and therere only a few people who dis who object i mean so s right yeah thats why i was saying if we could just unplug them and plug them in well i mean thats the other option is that we could switch the form so its more obvious the distinction between channel and mike um and then get you know pretty duplicates i mean theres no problem with that its just what hmm should we get just more sony ones i hate the sony ones which ones are those b the one youre wearing because it it pinches the one im wearing oh those pinches the temples too much oh and i mean so if you wear it sort of around the back its not too bad yeah i hate it because its hard to adjust the microphone i mean i spend all this time fumbling around with it and still not yeah but i right reasonable yeah right so i mean we could try another mike but then we have the wiring issue and so i i dont know what to do what do what do people think but the problem is again the the plug or wh the plug is proprietary so thats why i was saying getting more sony ones is trivial because we can just go out and buy them any other ones we have to buy them in pigtail versions and get them wired ok ok ok yeah ok n now may maybe i just dont know this but um are the only two possibilities from sony the two that weve tried or is there another yes so the only possibilities from sony are that one and the lapel mike i see ok ok oh i see so this isnt sony this is crown the one were wearing isnt that something ok and so we had these wired for us oh i see ok well it s it seems like right now if if u what theyre complaining are those if we just got two more of these and so huh i remember that now i think thats probably the right first step is just get two more immediately and have them available yeah ok and then they can just unplug those from the right and just make sure that you write down crown or sony on the mike number which ill change to mike type or something like that transmitter mmhmm mmhmm yeah it might be good to double check at the end of the meeting too cuz that would be an easy place for uh an error in the data yep for it to be forgotten well itll be me itll be whoevers setting up the meeting who fills out the key file so ok its just im just thinking that if itd be yeah but i know but i mean to have the user fill it out wouldnt be as reliable as have the it has the same potential for error as everything else no no we definitely would not have the user fill it out it would be me chuck or liz depending on which meeting it is good ok perfect perfect ok ok so well de definitely go ahead and do that how much is it just to buy the mike couple hundred really yeah is that more or less than you thought it depends on how good the mike is oh thats way more than i thought i yeah oh ok yeah for one of these well the crown ones were like twofifty i think those are like oneninety god oops wow but is there any educational discount yeah right no student discount yeah good mikes are expensive so and when i was at computer motion we used shure the smtenas and i think they were only like eighty bucks or something mmhmm yeah eighty or ninety for the shures so yeah but they were they seemed pretty good i mean the sony ones are expensive because theyre proprietary so they can charge whatever they want these are expensive because theyre quite high quality so oh right right so we should buzz that out if we send the data to sony ah come on we should keep a list of things were gonna bleep out and the conditions under which well im just joking so you do not have to bleep that out i dont mind if sony knows my opinion so hmm um also were pro i wanna double check with morgan he did say yes before i went to japan on buying another wireless system so that we can go all wireless instead of the mix of wired and wireless and i think thats the right thing to do so then all those red channels there would become wireless ones and im yeah yep cool yep uhhuh four more wireless um and also im gonna re probably replace the andrea mike with a shure but ill test it uh sometime today or tomorrow to make sure the shure one really works cuz i have an extra shure in my office the andrea mike yeah yeah apparently its had some problems thats causing problems yeah which one is the andrea mike it was over here sometimes a wired one the yeah a wired one yeah its uh well if youre gonna go to all wireless oh you mean in the meantime this one in the meantime right because uh ah i see yeah itll itll probably take a couple weeks to get it delivered from sony anyway yeah i havent in the meetings that i recorded s so its always been at most six people so ive never had to oh really yeah recently i havent had to used any of the wired ones at all i guess cuz everyones been out of town probably over the summer itll be the same cuz it tends to be less yeah fewer people um file uh done with microphone issues i think should we close the door if you want oh im thinking i dont know about the acoustics thats thats all i was wondering about and this way we can get a doorslam in the uh in the transcript file yeah yeah thats right we gotta get the obligatory doorslam oh well no not quite a slam theres some knocks get a special phone for that mmhmm uh the doorslam phone i guess right the doorslam phone yeah you have a special phone no we could add one oh we could add one yeah and then we could have the phone phone yeah thats an idea for for when the phone rings um uh file reorganization this is something we were talking about before i left and saying we should probably wait until after im back and now im back so we should do that at some point so we should get ourselves a list of everything we wanna do to reorganize the file structure and anything else can i can i just mention something sure um uh i think the file regards reorganization also um another issue there is disk space probably right um so mmhmm i know that the files that youve been cutting up for us f for the recognition experiments uh one way one really mmhmm brain uh braindead way of of of not causing any trouble but saving disk space is to uh use the s the sphere the nist uh wencode program to to encode you know to compress them shorten is that the same as shorten uh yeah but it does it s it happens so that the program that reads the waveforms does the unshortening transparently yeah well ok you mean its built into the sri because we have the same thing with shorten in the sound tools so y uh i guess but it um so its just a question of of what decompression is built into your tools well its well like hhh its actually built into the sphere library that nist delivers so right oh really i didnt know that and actually s the sound tools dont understand that for the at least feacalc doesnt at least feacalc doesnt so well thats not a sound tool right but since since these files are made to be used with the sri recognizer uh and the sri frontend uses the sphere library which in turn does this transparently um uh that will be a quick and quick and easy way to just uh get you know uh be able to use more yeah mmhmm the other thing i could do to relieve some of the pressure um is just move everything to my eighteen gig disk which is local but thats gonna be only temporary well i mean i dont know i mean you should do that too probably but but as you do that you can also just run the yeah it is kind of a temporary solution to shorten everything well actually the th what you do is you run oh now i have another use for the the way i recently used it and there might be better ways so the programs called wencode mmm and i think the type y you say um i think dash t and then there are different different encoding methods but if you wanna use the shorten one you say d minus t shorten and then the old uh wavefile and the new wavefile and then oops and then i check you know if this works so you can use the the shell and operator or something then i just move the new wavefile to the you know to the old right wavefile and then you have replaced the old one with one that behaves identically as long as your programs that use it know how to mmhmm decode it on the fly and that ok that just saved my butt because i actually was running on a different experiment i had segmented i was processing the whole switchboardtwo corpus which is two hundred eighty hours of speech and i was noticing as i was almost finishing the processing that i was running out of disk space mmhmm and and so i uh had this flash of inspiration of just uh the same the same disk had the segmented waveforms on them so i shortening everything on the fly while this other thing was still going on i was run i was running this this thing you had another process running that was shortening it yep wow wow and low and behold i gained three g three gig of space and um you know wow did you have to renice one of the processes to make sure that shorten no no actually it was fast enough this is very fast this this really runs quickly and thats wow that must have been suspenseful watching the disk meter that was very suspenseful that was that was the most excitement i had all weekend uh uh boy it uh came out just fine so to be ok you know what would be a u i dont know if this would mess other things up but it seems like kind of a pain to have all these split up files around what would be easier would be like pointers the list yep you know lists like original wavefile start end start end this is yep the way feacalc calc does it right the the only reason we do this is because the the sri frontend doesnt have a way to to um go into a l a longer file with indices um so i i suppose and segment on the fly someone could try to put a hack like that into the it would be easy it wouldnt be hard at all someone just needs to d sit down and do it who has some time so but theres also some i guess and that way we wouldnt have multiple versions floating around about the only difficulty with that is if its compressed then you really do have to decompress it first thats true right because the pointers are y you dont know how much its comp well is there is there is there a nist routine which it doesnt compress it by a fixed amount exactly right right right right right can seek in a compressed file but with uncompressed indices i dont think so and yeah i mean that it no no i mean if you th the the the if you can operate on the full if you dont have to segment it then there would be less of a reason to do the compression because you dont have that wasted right that extra copy so right we i mean the original switchboard files are not compressed right so we could leave those as they are yeah right well i mean it just depends on how much disk space is a problem i mean the what you could do is decompress it to a temporary place and then operate on it and then delete it right but i mean the segmentation also saves you space in the sense that you cut out all the nonspeech regions just silences yeah and if you have you know twenty channels and only five speakers then its thats true mmhmm well assuming youd yeah assuming that you then offload the original yeah switchboard files so mmm yeah well it seems like just shortening them is a good shortterm solution so we dont have to do any coding yeah yeah yeah but i think kind of weve had there was a big disk crash when you were gone and so no it was i was still here it was the day i left oh was that the day you left thats suspicious he did it on purpose yeah leave to japan the day the disk crashes no if i if i had done it on purpose i would have timed it right after i left but um yeah so chuck helped me out in uh r regenerating all the cha the different channel files for like a few meetings for like six meetings so i think theyre split up even further its kind of even more disorganized now since mmhmm we moved some of the meetings to different directories theyre on a different disk even right are they i think you didnt you expand them to xe on abbott xf no you the ones that oh different ones you the ones that you put them on when you put them on xe i dont remember where i put them now i think you put them on xe so ok well what we what we found out was that um the disk that crashed was it w with a with a meta disk allocation you had both c t transcripts and the shortened files and the expanded files were all on xe were on the same sorry different partitions of the same physical disk physical disk mmm and its conceivable i mean i i dont i mean so um i was told that its possible that that might have uh caused additional wear on it maybe caused it to to go bad sooner well i think there was something else going on because uh dave johnson said that dd was getting accessed frequently and it shouldnt be hmm oh uhhuh right that data never gets touched because we write it once and then we never touch it again well why not oh sure it does yeah after each meeting we copy the data to except that well i mean so the wavefiles or or anything at all because the transcripts are there as well the wave files i mean he was saying gigabytes oh gigabytes i see and so it has to be the wave files yeah there was something weird about that yeah thats right yeah so i asked dave about it and he hasnt looked into it yet but we should definitely double check on it yeah like like the same meeting shortened files that we pull off of popcorn when were done doing the recording yeah looked to the backup software as if they had been written you know every single night every night is that right i for f you know a week in a row which is really weird thats very strange i didnt realize that ok wow so at any rate so for file reorganization we need to first decide what were gonna do and then when were gonna do it yeah so im not sure who isnt involved with that i mean certainly me chuck and jane anyone else care and i and id like in terms of the conventions to also uh you know s send a bit to dan ellis to see if its if theres any get his input on it i dont think i dont think thatll be yeah no right so maybe we should do that yeah not during this meeting but s another time and just get a list of everything were gonna do yeah yeah yeah maybe n next week if we could im trying to finish up some stuff ok yeah sure id like to so just update all the naming conventions and put all the files where they really belong on one disk that sounds like a good idea and then leave leave everything in place until the backup until the next full backup and then delete the old ones mmhmm ok now and youre just youre not talking about the s the x disks the x uh partitions just the backed up space or so well both need to be reorganized ok so um various paths th i mean this is why we have to do it in a synchronized way because um i think we should also at the same time try to uh convert over to your new naming conventions yes exactly that too thatd be good so thats what i was saying we need to get a list of all that stuff that we wanna do yeah ok and so i didnt really get any responses from the naming conventions that i sent out so i assume thats alright with everyone i actually havent looked at it yet i havent had a chance so no hmm i havent either sorry oh and i will by next week though uh i dont know about the naming i mean ok then i should have made that as an agenda item th so these names that weve been using so far are with uh uh uh i wouldnt just wanna change them you know without some advance notice right i mean th thats all these segment names that we weve been using i would rather not mess with them yeah yeah im until we have some closure on some of the things we are currently right dealing with so well i mean how you choose to do it the naming is up to you right well so youre talking about different files i mean it should probably be eventually should probably be consistent with what youre doing but yep yeah i kind of agree with andreas like im a little bit i mean these i looked at the naming conventions and they look fine to me but at the same time it was just like you know to rename everything would be well if we if we change things it wont really affect what youre doing will it this no but i think just to be consistent we should also i mean have the same conventions just in case you want right yeah so you but you can switch that any time you want right yeah yeah i mean its only gonna affect my work so yeah its not gonna i mean if we i assume youre not gonna go like into you know my directories and change my file names so yeah everybody will use it fine slash u slash star right i actually i was gonna do a global searchreplace on all entries at at icsi to change mr to mrm at all places at icsi yeah thatd be great really enjoy that with no with no advance warning y you well maybe i shouldnt say that on re record ok there was a typo in some of the contracts that morgan got that someone one of our sponsors did a global sear search and replace for between sponsor and their name mmhmm oh no oh no and so it it was saying uh well anyway i wont yeah one one can imagine that that might be problematic im not sure whether thats right yeah one can imagine the problems that that would engender but this this name change affects a subset doesnt need to reflect everything yeah so right right um thilo you had you wanted to talk about the yeah i had one one short point i have just installed a transcriber version on one of our nt machines so its available under windows now oh great actually someone i just got an email this week from someone as isnt that great yeah i re responded to sh i have already responded to him i i dont know what what what he what the problem was it was really straightforward really easy to anant and this is not mmhmm oh im sorry i i just so who did you talk to there was some some guy from sri who wanted to to install yeah anant anant venkataraman ok yeah and he sent an email that he couldnt couldnt install it and i i just described him well what i did and it was really straightforward so yeah ok great yeah ok great great thanks thanks and this is not just the transcriber this is the channeltrans right yeah its the channeltrans so the yeah yeah excellent the cool things that dave gelbart excellent so you should probably talk to a sys admin and get it put in some central place so that itll work on all the nt machines well i mean as it stands i i guess yeah i see what you mean itll itll be on the on the unix side but accessible through the hdrive yeah ok ive right ok yeah i could do that so i assume tcltk wasnt already on the machine so you had to install it yeah i had i to install it yeah huh yeah uh so andreas would it be appropriate to ask how the experiments are going uh oh well yeah i i i actually wasnt sure whether this is the right meeting for it because it has uh very little to do with with meeting recordings but hmm you know i did uh run um some recognition experiments with icsi frontend um uh and and you know this is the j joint work with chuck and uh um so first uh you know we had we figured out sometime last week how to um and and chuck wrote this really nice little script perl script that takes a uh waveform runs the feature calculation and then dumps it out into the into um a f c socalled uh cepstra file which is what the sri system uses to read features its essentially uh uh nist headered uh waveform you know it looks like a waveform except instead of samples you have feature vectors following the header hmm mmhmm and um thats all done um by the script and it works great and uh i first trained up two systems because its genderdep you know the sri system is genderdependent so to be comparable i trained uh um on a sh on a socalled short training set um a male system and a female system and uh also for debugging purposes and for the heck of it i trained um trained uh on the same training set uh a standard system with the sri frontend from scratch um and compared the two so w what features did you use well we used uh twelve plp uh uh so not rasta just plp just plp just plp and actually that uh one of the questions i had was what the rasta would possibly buy us but um well talk about that later so the uh so the baseline system w the sri system was uh used uh also uh uh used t twelve uh mel uh mel cepstra um based on a twentyfour filter bank um analysis um i do not know what so the f the bandwidth of the um sri frontend is from hundreds hertz to th th thirtyse thirtyseven fifty or something like that thirtyseven fifty and i do not know what the um icsi um frontend would do i mean what the bandwidth is um but the results are such that uh lets see theres one other slight difference right or two two differences oh yeah so the sri system also does um vocal tract length normalization and we couldnt figure out how to do that yet with the icsi features so thats one difference and the other difference is that in the uh in the sri system the uh th the first the czero the energy uh feature is normalized slightly differently from the rest and what they do is huh they d they subtract the maximum for each waveform segment they subtract the maximum of of th over that waveform segment from from the values of for that waveform which is a kind of automatic gain control that is localized do they subtract the max from each i one or do they subtract each one from the max who cares they subtract doesnt matter no just would be a sign change except you get a lot of negatives the other way right right right um and then after but after they done this waveform based normalization they then do a conversation length normalization just like all the other features so its their kind of two stage normalization oh oh um now i understand that the common practice here has been to just do c standard uh mean subtraction um on the waveform um for the czero right but in what weve done so far because we didnt have any special provision for czero we just treat it as as any of the other features weve done standard mean subtraction over the whole conversation side so um since both sri and icsi use this sort of local normalization for czero thats presumably you know someone has done some experiments to and found out that that works better um so thats another difference and that might account for some of the discrepancies in the results um but you know so the the results are um where should i start uh the so theres a two oh i tried it with and without uh so without and with adaptation how many iterations for the adaptation mmhmm well y we always do three em iterations to ok and its its this its this quick and dirty the phone loop adaptation which doesnt actually require prior recognition paths and and so this is not the best you can do with adaptation but it gives you sort of a first idea of what you could gain with it and then you know so we have the the sri frontend and the icsi frontend and other than that the system configuration was identical so it was the same they came up with um you know same number of uh gaussians per state cluster um same the clustering used the same information loss threshold which actually led to roughly the same number of gaussians overall so that the system configuration is is comparable um and the uh so without adaptation you had fortynine p thats error rate or recognition rate this is error rate in percent and with adaptation its fortyseven point one and this this was fiftytwo point six and fiftyone point three hmm and then when i combined them i can actually combine them with something like rover its actually more sophisticated than rover but its um here i got fortyeight point five and here i got fortysix point five so this is just combination at the utterance level um at the utterance level right why do you think the icsi frontend is so much worse good question thats fine that seems really odd to me um so one percent i would attribute to the lack of vtl about one percent ok oh right right right right ok ah ok and then maybe another up i dont know how much the czero normalization business really matters i cant it see i mean cant see it the ca can you run the sri just as an experiment run the sri frontend without vocal tract norma normalization and see how much difference it makes i could yeah i could certainly do that yeah um we could also do the vocal tract length normalization with the icsi features thats something we wanted to do yeah we could i was actually thinking we could use the warping factors that we compute for the mfccs yeah if we could figure out how yeah and just try them with the icsi uh frontend because we already have the capability to apply the warping to the um to the plp c uh dan added the yeah dan added that in but yeah but the so they wont they dont correspond oneto one though no but they should be close since this i mean the anyway but i can certainly try the sri frontend without uh vtl that sh thats thats certainly quick to do yeah um and so yeah and and then theres all these um you know the number of um you know this frontend u had a fair amount of experimentation going into it you know how many mmhmm filter banks do you use what what bandwidth do you use and stuff like that and uh we could play the same kind of games with the icsi frontend right uh actually the analysis bandwidth played a very crucial role we used to use a narrow bandwidth and uh uh that hurt us so this is um and this is weve now used roughly what everybody else is using so hmm um theres some room for improvements i figure in this in the icsi frontend um so but the good news is that even with this with the icsi system being that much worse you still get a win out of combining the two so that gives some hope for the future um unfortunately however this seems to be reduced with adaptation so um also interestingly the um the difference actually widens i would actually expect it or or hope that the adaptation reduces the difference because it might um for instance um remove some of the um you know som if you if you have some some difference in the frontend processing that uh is suboptimal but can be possibly remedied by you know moving the um moving the models around but but apparently that doesnt doesnt really actually the difference becomes larger so um anyway so right now what im doing is um uh well theres several things going on one is that chuck is working on uh getting the tandem features um into a form that we can train the tandem the system on the tandem features so that would actually be the more interesting experiment um the other thing is im training uh retraining the models on the large training set that we usually use to build our evaluation models and then we can right and i actually want to do the system combination um with our eval system um on some subset of the data at least probably only for the males because i dont have time to train both males and females but um uh and um what about ta concatenating the two feature vectors into a single one it gets pretty big it does get pretty big yeah hmm and m my experience with that in broadcast news was usually combining at other levels works better hmm so for for whatever thats worth oh you tried that on broadcast news concatenating oh yeah yeah so w yep different feature sets yeah did you try uh it was mostly msg plp rasta i see so you know the feature sets we had available and it was almost always better to combine at the probability level you know so wed run the neural nets and combine the probabilities i see ok alright oh yeah and it does become sort of unwieldy to have these very large feature vectors and that would yep blow up the youd also have to do some sort of normalization afterwards uh so that theyre uh orthogonal right so youd wanna do a linear transform also right um so the yeah and then we could start experimenting a little bit to try to get the icsi frontend to perform better um and and as a preliminary just sort of diagnostic experiment we can i can certainly run a sri system without vtl yep just uh to get wi without what without vtl ok just vocal tract thing yeah wh yeah and that thats quick to do so i was thinking about tandem system well lets not talk about it here but i had some thoughts about the tandem system yeah so but things are moving ahead so ok should we do digits digits sure do we have any other topics ok

over one eight one four two eight two four five four you can really tell from the prosody where it goes s meeting i actually have one more thing that i dont know if its i if if its allowed to to bring up after the dis after digits i dont know anyway but it might be important for um so liz remarked that she had recorded a meeting where go ahead it was later found that several of the s microphones were turned off um mmhmm and this must become a problem especially with nonspeechmeetings so um is there a way that the software could warn you if it gets zeros from some of the channels or probably we could probably build that in to the frontend because it you know its really annoying if you go through all that trouble and then basically the meetings arent useable because uh even what are people doing theyre switching their mikes off or something i dont know what they do maybe the batteries went dead or th they just didnt they played with the thing and it didnt leave it in the on position or whatever i dont know uh eh fff what would you like it to do when that happens well no if if you um i mean obviously you always i mean theres never gonna be a signal from all the channels right because or rarely um but uh well if an unblacked out channel is zero is actually spitting out zeros you can be pretty sure its off right because it doesnt spit out zeros it spits out epsilons right cuz theres little background noise the question is when the software detects it what do you want it to do exactly thats a good question i dont know but is there some we can collectively think of some of some mechanism that might reduce the risk of of just i mean it it it we we already have visual feedback right you can see whether your mike is working or not um right right so maybe its just to admonish people to actually look at the screen at the beginning of the meeting to make sure they get a signal yep test turn off the screen saver during the meeting tell them to test their mikes or yeah something i think they sh yeah i d i dont know what to do other than it it can beep if one of the channels dies while recording theres no sound out right now oh never mind it should give the electric shock to the person recording the meeting yep yep yeah yeah that would be good well we can think about what to do about it but it oh yeah thats a good one wow thats not a bad idea yeah ok its pretty clear we can detect it so yeah alright ok are we done yeah 
 i would say between the ages of 7 to 10 years old it was a really big thing to go to the movie on saturday mornings and one particular movie theater we went to they would show serials every saturday which were a continued story so if you missed one saturday you would miss what happened in a particular episode and you um wouldnt know what had taken place so we would go every saturday morning and also at this theater they gave prizes to different people and one of the way they gave prizes was they would take big group photos and everybody and there were stairs going up to a balcony real wide stairs and the big group of people would go stand on the stairs and there would be probably 30 or 40 kids in the picture and theyd take the picture and then you would go back the next saturday after they had been developed and they would have circled 3 or 4 people in the picture and the people whose head was circled would get the prizes is that for real thats for real that really happened and one time i can remember i think it was steve my brother um he and they would give treats like candy i dont even remember what all kinds of prizes the would give but for some reason and i think this is really true he got ice cream sandwiches like a box of ice cream sandwiches and of course theres nothing to do with a box of ice cream sandwiches when youre at a 2hour movie theyre going to melt and another um that was in that was in high point nc and then we moved to charlotte and we used to go to and i dont think its even still there i dont know if the building is or not but the dilworth theatre i lived in the dilworth area and we would go to the dilworth theatre and i do remember that it cost 9 cents to get a ticket to get in and we would could go to the movie we would get maybe 15 cents each to go to the movie and i sound like im 95 years old with those kinds of prices um but we would go to the movie and then you would go in and get your your snack that you wanted and there were several different choices i dont ever remember getting popcorn at the movie until i was a teenager or in my adult life but we would uh buy lollipops is what they call them now but we called them suckers and we would get often a 2cent sucker are you making fun no i love this story and the 2cent suckers is what is referred to now as a tootsie roll pop and we called them 2cent suckers because every other sucker cost a penny except these were 2 cents because they had the tootsie roll in the middle and there was one other sucker that cost a nickel and we called that an all day sucker just because you couldnt eat the whole thing for the entire movie and you would really just have that sucker all day long and one other form of refreshment that we got which really embarrassed my mother because she didnt know anything about this until she went with us to the movie one saturday there was a bakery next door to the movie theatre and my brothers and myself were not the only people that did this all the kids that would go to the movie knew to do this we would go into the bakery and we would ask for a nickel worth of scraps and we didnt even have to ask for it because the bakery lady knew us and she knew to have all this ready for all the kids going to the movie and what it was it was broken cookies and broken pieces of whatever happened while they were baking mistakes so they would fill little bags for us and we would give them a nickel and we could take that to the movie theatre with us and thats all the stories i can remember about the movies right now i do know that i did used to go the movie downtown at the carolina theatre and when i was young it wasnt a strange thing for the kids to just go off and go to a movie i mean my mother knew where we were going and she knew when we would get back but today you wouldnt send your seven or eight year old child to a movie theatre alone even if they were with their nine year old brother you just wouldnt do it and we could skate to the movie or ride a bicycle to the movie and we would do that which is kind of sad that you cant do that anymore and its not just because things are therere bad people in the world but its too much traffic you have to check everything about a movie check it out to see what the content is and just wasnt like that when i was growing up also about that same time period in my life i guess again between seven and ten years old which seems to be what i remember most vividly my best friend uh was kathy josey and she was a next door neighbor also and we remained friends up until uh she was about 35 and she passed away with cancer but we we remained close friends in fact we shared an apartment first apartment either one of us ever had and when we were um little girls we used to play career girls we did and we used to try to dress up and pretend we were businesswomen and we would go to work and pretend we had an apartment together and then when we grew up we sure did we got an apartment uhhuh um kathy and i also used to play other kind of dress ups and it just it seems like i remember we both had like our mothers long skirts or the skirts would be long on us and we would literally wear dress up clothes that belonged to our mothers but we had kathy had one pair of pearls or beads of some sort of necklace that was her mothers and i didnt have the necklace and it was really beautiful and i really really wanted one so we only had the one necklace and we er we decided i dont know if it was jointly or if kathy was just extremely nice of whatever but she said i could wear it part of the time and we would literally time the amount of time we wore it like 30 minutes or 15 minutes or whatever and the way we decided who got to wear it first and this always kind of bothered me because i know kathy did this intentionally she said the youngest one got to wear it first and she was like six months younger than i am so it that became a normal thing with us whenever we only had one of something she would always say well i think the youngest one gets to do it or wear it or whatever first and that just always stuck in my mind that in in our adult life i brought that up to her and she sort of acted like she didnt know anything about that and i thought to myself she does and then she laughed about it and she realized that she had kinda held a trump card on that one um also we did a lot of pretending and as i said we played career girls and the dress ups and my sister and i used to pretend also and jill is about 2 years younger than i am maybe two and a half and we used to play robin hood except we didnt have a maid marion we had a saretha i dont know where in the world that name came from but we would switch playing robin hood one would play robin hood and one would play saretha and saretha was the counter would be the same thing as maid marion and why again i dont know why we didnt use maid marion but in my mind i can remember playing that like all day long and we would go over to my grandparents and they had a a big white house with a big front porch and uh banisters on it and a lot of rocking chairs out on the front porch and it was just a great place to pretend and we would climb up on the porch and on the banisters and we could make those our horses or uh it could be a castle just do many things with it um and when we were still living in high point in our back yard we had a huge i dont know i guess it was an oak tree but it was a really big tree but it was a climbable tree and it had real large thick branches extending out to the side and they were fat enough branches where as a child of eight and nine years old we could straddle the branches and that was another game that jill and i used to play we would pretend we were in the jungle and we would climb up on the tree and we would straddle the tree branches and pretend it was our elephant and in the yard we had an old tree that had been cut down and just the stump was remaining and my mother had planted um flowers all around that stump and we would use that stump as a as a throne and the princess got to sit up on that stump on that throne and have all those flowers around her and that would be the throne and she would be the queen or the princess or whatever when i was a teenager an audrey hepburn movie came out called wait until dark and i think i was probably 16 or 17 years old we were of driving age and i had a group of girlfriends that i ran around with and there were golly there mightve been 8 to 10 of us who were good friends everybody had their own best friend but then we had one big group that we used to do a lot of things together um and we would had that many girls but we would only go out in a couple of cars and i remember one of the girls betty belle her dad had a vw beetle and wed fit like 5 girls in that vw beetle did betty belle turn catholic no huhuh she didnt no so we went out one night to the movie but before we went to the movie we went to get pizza and then we went to and i think the name of the place was the open kitchen and we didnt have chain pizza places like we do now like pizza hut and all that this was just a really neat pizza place that all the kids would go and we went to open kitchen and we would have eight or 10 girls and we would order one pizza and all share it and everyone would only get one piece and i think we would make the waitresses mad because we didnt have money to leave tips we would also drink water so it wasnt a good situation for the waitresses but we had fun and we didnt even think about it we just did what we could get away with anyway that night we were gonna go see wait until dark and i think it was on at the manor theatre and i just remember when you have like 10 or so girls going somewhere to the same place its kind of a pretty much of a spectacle were all in this long line and were giggling and laughing and cutting up and having really a great time so we bought our tickets and we went into the manor theatre and we found a row of seats and we sat file all filed in and i just remember seeing and i was sitting in a middle section i was not on an end so i had girls i knew on both sides of me and i just remember that movie was had a lot of hype about being really scary and suspenseful and its nothing like these movies that are out today like scream and what is it nightmare on elm street whatever it is where theyre actual horror movies this was uh a real intense um drama and just very scary kept you on the edge of your seat and there was a scene in the movie i remember where every one of us and it wasnt just our group but so many people in the theatre they screamed out at one time and thats really all i remember about that night it was just a lot of fun and i really hope that my daughters have had some nights like that and has had good times like that that i can remember going out with good friends

 hi my name is sandra reid and i am part of a family of seven children um and my mom and dad have passed away during our young years we were very poor we did not have very much but my mom always found a way to keep us busy or keep us entertained and one of the ways that she kept us entertained was by telling stories reading poems and singing to us one of the stories that i would like to share with you is the story that is pretty scary and it sticks out into my mind i guess mostly mainly because it was scary even though my mom told us lot of scary stories she was always there to hold us in her arms and let us know that the story was not true and that it was we were ok out of all of my sisters and brothers i was the laziest one of all as far as working around the house all of my sisters learned to cook by the age of eight i learned after i got married so i was a pretty lazy child when it came down to cleaning up and cooking so one night my mother asked me to go inside and wash the dishes naturally i start crying and one of my main ways of getting out of work was always saying something hurt me either my stomach or that i had a headache or something was wrong with my leg just anything to get out of doing my job so after she noticed that i was going to be just a little stubborn and not follow do what she tell told me to do she asked me to come around in the living room with her and the rest of the family so she began to tell this story once upon a time there was this little girl and her family and the mother asked the little girl to please go in and wash the dishes so that she could go to bed early and not come up wake up in the morning and see all those dishes on the table and her little girl just complained i dont want to wash the dishes i dont want to my leg hurts my head hurts i dont feel good the little girl disappointed her mother so badly but her mother said how in the world am i ever going to get her to wash these dishes so she said little girl little girl if you dont go in there and wash those dishes like i asked you something really really bad is going to happen to you so the little girl just said ok ill go in there and wash the dishes and she was in there stomping and crying and mad and taking all her good time all of a sudden the butcher knife came out of the drawer and it began to roll around in the air and before you know it the butcher knife came around and cut the little girls head off and when the little girl went to heaven she was crying down to her dad and saying daddy daddy mama cut my head off with the butcher knife now that knife when i went to sleep it really scared me but the wonderful thing about it my mom was always there close by to let me know that i was ok now after that my mother continued to tell us many many scary stories and tell us many many many poems id like to tell you about how i got into becoming a teachers assistant all my life i always wanted to be a teacher even from the time i started to school that was my dream to teach school as i told you in the past we were a very poor family and i never got the chance to go to college because of this uh while i was in high school a teacher of mine noticed that i had an extra bone in my foot and she said well now sandra we can use this as get toward on your grant to go to college so she said go home and talk to your mother about it and see if we you know can follow through with applying for a grant scholarship grant for you so that night i went home and i asked my mother about it and she said baby i really want you to go to college its always been my dream that my children all go to school but because there are so many children in the family there are other things youre going to have to have to go to school and i just dont have the money at that time my dad was in prison at the time so it made it really hard for my mom i sat there and i cried but i tried to be as understanding as possible because i knew my mother struggled really hard to even keep food on the table for us so i never got a chance to go to school did anybody yes my brother went to school he went to livingstone and then to transferred to johnson c smith so to make it easier on my mom to as far as you know him staying at home and going to school too so he graduated from um johnson c smith here in charlotte i had another sister who went to gaston college where she got a business degree there i in later years i went on to college some but i didnt complete the uh whole four years um i remember once when i was working in a mill and i was spinning yarn and i was saying to myself and i was praying actually and i said god one day i want to work in the school system if i could just work even as a teacher assistant i would be happy as the years went by my prayer was answered and i got the chance to work in the cafeteria as a cashier and the principal there came up to me and said have you considered being a teacher assistant i said i would love to so they told me about some classes that i could take at central piedmont id never gone to college before i was really afraid but he told me to go ahead and try it so i took the entrance test and they accepted me into at the school and i took some courses there after a while the principal said i would like for you to bring me your um transcript so i can see what your grades are like luckily i had all as i did very well and he asked me to be a teacher assistant the next following year um my dream my prayers were answered i enjoy my job very much i cant think of any job that would make me any happier a few years later um i had the opportunity to apply for a scholarship to further my education at first i didnt want to apply for it but the principal called me during the summer months and said sandra the time is running out you need to apply and he told me i would have to write this paper well i didnt like writing at the time but i took it upon myself to go ahead and write a paper and i went to um one of my staff members and i asked her if she would proofread it and she thought it was an excellent paper and i went ahead and mailed it in thinking uh i wont get the scholarship who cares i dont just so i can work in the school ill be happy but one day i came in and i looked at my mail and i was accepted i couldnt believe it out of 150 assistants who had applied for this grant only 16 got the opportunity so i felt very proud of myself so i went on and took the courses and as i started i think i was taking economics i think that was the last class i took my husband became very ill with cancer and i had to make a decision as to whether i would continue my education or take care of him and i felt like i needed to take care of him because he stood by me so much while i was going to school but you would have been able to be a a teacher if you had continued yeah and at the time i was also working in the classroom i guess youd say as a sub because the teacher that i was working with at that time was pregnant and she had to take a leave of absence and they hired a sub but the sub didnt do that much i had to take over the classroom so i worked maybe like four months in the classroom and that highly put a damper on my wanting to be a teacher from all the responsibility along with the fact that i was taking care of a very sick husband after all of this was after i i decided not to continue ive never pursued the fact of going back to school i just got to a certain age and i said no i cant do this anymore so i never went back but i love what i do and uh anytime i get a chance to teach in a classroom i go for it so how many different schools did you teach at ive only worked at two two schools the first school i worked at was enderly park and then it was closed down so i was in those situations where i first come first transfer last come first to transfer out so i had to i was offered a job at ashley park or berryhill and i chose berryhill i didnt particularly want to come here and when i came here everybody noticed that i was really really sad because i loved being at enderly park but then after awhile i fell in love with berryhill if im not mistaken i think ive been at berryhill for i think 17 years 17 18 years ive been here at berryhill so and i hope i never have to leave until i retire and why did the other school close down um the you know i really dont know um that i really dont know why they closed that school down because it was a really nice school and everything but they eventually tore it down because i was there i think the first year i went there was the year they built a really nice gym and i dont think they used that gym no more than three years i really dont i dont remember why that school was ever closed but it was and i enjoy what i do thats it all right thank you thank you 
 my name is bonnie rindner and i was born in san antonio tx and the story im going to tell is about my mother um a little background first her lets see her mothers family were wealthy people at one time they owned car dealerships and extensive land um i dont know if they were farmers or not but i know they were land owners um many acres and um her grandmother was raised in wealth uh then the depression came and apparently everyone lost all their money um she was raised in mo and she married a man this is my grandmother im talking about and they were very poor by this point and they had i think seven children and one particular christmas things were very very difficult there was no money to buy any presents at all um for the children and my grandfather who was killed when my mother was 16 this was of course way before that um he must have been a very positive person because what he did with the situation was he he told the children that there were no presents this christmas because they had given them all to santa to take the poor children and this made the children feel happy and proud of themselves and it gave them a good feeling that they had done something very nice for someone less fortunate than themselves um i felt like that was a way to face that situation with such hope and with joy and with love and although i never met my grandfather i have never forgotten that story and when i hear of him i think what a wonderful wonderful person he must have been and how long have you lived in charlotte oh i have lived in charlotte um for a year um i lived in charlotte for five years we came here in 1986 we lived here for five years then we moved to raleigh for seven years and now weve been back one year well good 
 uh how do you feel about gun control uh on the scale they gave one to ten id say im probably a four im not totally im not one of these people that believes that we should not be able to buy guns but i dont think we should be carrying uzis either you know what i mean yeah i know i mean i dont think machine guns automatic weapons i dont believe in things like that but i think some people do i know that everyone should have the right to have a hand gun in their house if they so choose and but i think there should be some restrictions when you buy one you know they should do more background search on you they should i think it should be harder to buy one right yeah theres a lot of crazies out there that can just go in and buy a gun because they dont really ask a lot of questions when you walk into those stores yeah no they dont they dont ask anything except how old you are i dont think thats kind of scary im from california my mom the last time i was like purchased a gun my my mom was getting a rifle for my brother that he wanted like an antique one and uhhuh they he had to fill out some forms but i guess california might be tougher i dont know yeah they might be or you know how we are here in texas its like everybodys a hunter so im not much of a hunter but yeah its ive never even bought a gun myself my dads given it to me or someones given me one so im probably real illegal you know carrying guns that arent even mine yeah its a its a hard decision to make it really is uh the only problem i have with gun control is that they the radicals wanna ban all kinds of weapons and then the only people carrying guns are gonna be be the people who are gonna kill you anyway like the bumper sticker its true yeah yeah exactly right it really is because theyre gonna get them one way or another they will always have a way look at drugs they always have a way to get that so right right right and theyre illegal so i dont think it would do us any good to outlaw them all together no i yeah i i i i i agree that it would be like people in people that are uh criminals are the ones that are gonna get them and then you have no defense against these people when they do come into your house or something right thats true i think they ought to teach people how to shoot them too how to take care of one how to act around one when they buy them yeah i have have gun gun have have gun management 101 right yeah exactly you cannot take the gun home until youve taken this course sign up here something like that yeah or required required required for every college student oh right exactly before graduation god gun control its its such a heated topic in the the and people get so emotional about it yep oh yeah they do they get real emotional about it all the ive worked with a lot of people that hunt and they just they they dont see any sense in it at all they think its ridiculous to have any kind of gun control but then of course theyre hunters they know what theyre doing they dont realize therere a bunch of crazy people out there that some of them are crazy too whew yeah yeah they go out there and get drunk and start shooting dont use it for that well yeah thats true they shoot each other thinking theyre a deer yeah darn i thought you were a deer bob sorry my mistake yeah marge i dont know what happened to your husband he just never came back looked like antlers i dont know yep that happens a lot too yeah oh but i guess thats it thats my opinion on it so what now im not sure uh uh i think we just hang up yeah okay thanks bye i lets see yeah yeah we just say goodbye and hang up okay okay okay thanks byebye 
 have you ever got one of those calls thats either generated by a computer or somebody going down a list and theyre either offering a service or theyre introducing some new product in the area and normally when they call youre either in the shower or you in the middle of cooking something and you had to stop everything to run to the phone yes yes that is that one that you were talking about that was the big one im talking about i work weird hours and invariably just about the time im going to sleep the phone tears off the wall uhhuh uhhuh and youre trying to crawl out of a half unconscious sleep and answer the phone you either hear the click as soon as you say hello you hear the click of the recording coming on umhum or you hear somebody already starting reading reading off a list of stuff that theyve read probably a thousand times that day already thats true or the ones that are are generated by a computer its just a computer voice that comes on the line those are the ones that i really really hate too even had some of them the theyre voice activated and youve got to say hello twice before theyll do anything uhhuh uhhuh yeah sometimes i i get them on my uh answering machine at home so and i hate that when ive got a whole bunch of messages and i go through them and most of them arent from anybody at all what i would love to see done to stop all of this uhhuh weve got a thing in this country you can have your phone number unlisted umhum i think a law should be passed to where any of these people i think its great that you know freedom of speech in this country and everything but if theyre going to offer these services or these recorded message everything they ought to be stuck working with the phone book like everybody else instead of using a computer to go through and just go down every sequence of numbers for this certain area code and call them umhum yeah see i have an unlisted telephone number but i still get all of those calls and then some of them are speaking in a foreign language that i dont even understand so yeah i do i really feel that thats uh an invasion of my privacy i agree with you on that particular subject there let me see thats about that as far as any other everyday occurrences i put a stop to some of them as far as the doortodoor either religious groups or people umhum peddling products if i wanted their products i wouldve either gone to the store to bought it or i wouldve called for their salesman salesman to come out umhum umhum yeah thats true living in an apartment complex though you know you cant um you cant really stop those people from coming around even though they put up signs out front that says no solicitations uh but they still come up to the front door and uh you know walk around so usually what i do is ill call the apartment manager and tell him hey theres people coming around you know and theyre trying to sell something or or theyre from a religious organization and i really hate that i really really do i had somebody come to the door about two weeks ago and um gosh it was about nine oclock at night too it wasnt even what i would consider you know a family hour its time to you know start going to bed and uh and it was somebody from um oh what was it the uh jesus christ of latter day saints and uh ive read a lot about uh that particular sect and i dont particularly care for it so i especially dont like for them to come up to my door and try and talk to me now i agree with their right to um pursue their religion of choice in that whatever manner they want to but i think they also should respect the sanctity of the american home whether it be in a house or in an apartment umhum im on my turf if i want them there ill call for them otherwise i dont want to know they exist right yeah yeah no i i agree with you there though i mean they want to choose that particular religion then thats fine with me too you know as long as they dont try and pull me in and drag me in and and i dont like the way that they do it either and and its their mission as they do as they go doortodoor and they go out into the public and they actually have the uh teenagers serving two years like you would say like in an army and two years in going around and doing missionary type work and i dont know i just um i just dont particularly care for that at all and that thats one thing that i feel really strongly about though is uh you know people coming up to my door especially religious organizations and wanting to uh you know to try and get me to join or you know become interested in their religion because i have my own now the part about where you said the apartment complex puts up signs that says no soliciting ive even gone so far as to put that ive got a storm door on the front of the house and ive put in i dont know how much clearer it can be its a red sign with silver letters saying no soliciting i should have guessed i guess i should make another one that says religious or otherwise because i still get yeah yeah thats true yeah no i dont uh i dont have i didnt go that far but uh yeah i probably could do the same thing uh you know i dont have a storm door but im sure i could rig up something but you know i dont think that that would stop people i mean its like they they see that word and it says uh go instead of stop oh goodness wonder if thered be some way we could get these people that do this get their names their addresses and their phone numbers and then reverse it and do well that would be technically illegal itd be harassment oh gosh but i consider invasion of my privacy yeah yeah a harassment in itself yeah yeah yeah thats true thats true hm well what else i believe weve pretty much summed everything up i know but i remember you you talked about something you started off and you said well let me think you talked about the telephone calls people coming and soliciting selling things at the door you said something else and i cant remember what it was and i thought yeah that that kind of touched a nerve right there but we got uh we got to talking about the um uh people coming to you at the front door im drawing the blank oh goodness okay is our five minutes up uh pretty close to it well ive enjoyed talking with you pretty close well it was nice talking to you too jim and take it easy now good night okay thanks bye 
 all right amy how are you doing today fine fine oh all righty i think we know what were going to speak about um tell you what ill start off hows that yeah okay you go ahead um i personally think to set a mark with the judicial system and were talking about criminals criminal cases that they should bring back umhum hangings on weekends in public places in public places there is one state that does that by the way yeah really what is that i want to say oklahoma i saw report something the other night about it hm they dont do them real often which is obviously the death penalty yeah yeah um but i think if we quit uh building these taj mahals with the color tvs and sixty dollars sixty thousand a year to keep an inmate in there on a on a on a life sentence we should start hanging them and get it over with and lets just screwing up the system uh yeah well the sentences are so unbelievable i just saw on the news last night that they said the average time a sentenced murderer you know is in jail is two years before hes paroled and a rapists is like six months and a burglar is like two months thats pathetic thats pathetic its because they just say theres either no room in the system you know in the jails for them or you know its just that it seems like the automatic sentences if if a judge has leeway on what hes going to you know sentence someone for between you know two months and uh fifty years and you know whats his whim to decide it should be two months this is true and and and and and the way the law reads uh if they sentence you to you know its crazy life in prison then hes available for parole if its if its life and a day then hes not eligible for parole so what you know lets quit bsing with the system yeah well even if its life like you say we end up spending sixty thousand dollars a year to keep some you know joker in there for life we could spend that money you know for starving children that are starving or twelve million other things would be more useful than that exactly so to me if somebody has life you know beyond a reasonable doubt they should that should be it you know particularly for some of these really a life for a life i mean there are so many just major major serial murders and its not just like one instance or something its just uh horrifying some of the murders that go on the old charles manson case i mean the guy is really yeah and the yeah theres just everyday you hear on the news of another one like that um just shouldnt be allowed to to even even live uh about the issue about sentencing by the judge yeah umhum the the judge presently has an opportunity to intervene uh when theres uh my understanding when theres uh a verdict and it for example theres a hung jury here in fort worth two day in eight to four and bam bam the guy got off uh he was uh he he was a veterinarian and killed two a father and a son okay right yeah i heard about that on the news yeah um kind of gets back to the second request weve been asked to look at is most criminal cases requiring an ananimous verdict the a situation like that id say no lets just go like a regular vote eight to four tells me that there were eight theres a percentage certain percentage of the people there with sixty percent of the people uh seventy percent of the people said hey right rather than have to retrial the whole whole thing and spend all the money for people to you know go back to court and all the lawyers and i mean it just winds up costing the taxpayers a fortune you know a fortune to keep doing that the guys guilty exactly and the victims you know the family of these people that have been murdered they just have to have it dragged on for years and years before they ever get any resolution exactly because its not next day they have the start the trial which is x number of months and just prolongs the situation that much more right yeah yeah i think that that if its if its not a split decision uh go with the highest number and lets just get on with the program yeah yeah uh but as far as the sentencing by the judge i would have to vote against that since theres a jury because thats what the juries are for is to make the decision um what are your feelings yeah yeah well if i i saw on one of the talk shows this woman judge i believe from florida and she just has just really stiff penalties and i saw that in in the hands of a judge that really was conscientious and really you know took the pains to give a sentence for what was deserved it could you could have a a judge that would really make a good impact but likewise you could have the flip side and have some judge that was paid off or you know had good a good old boy network or for whatever reasons you know politics just let all kinds of people through so he he would have a heck or she would have a heck of a lot of power you know if used wrongly so at least the jury system does something to prevent that you know or help it with it anyway i dont know if it prevents it but seems like the jury system does have its advantages but i also ive also heard on trials that sometimes they go through like three hundred jurors before they hand pick these jurors that they think are going to be the ones that are going to be the most lenient you know and i dont know how much theyre getting just a jury of their peers at that point theyre really getting a select group its not just random people hm it almost should be the first twelve people that they you know that have on a list are the ones that are on the jury and thats it yeah yeah i get back to prices comment when he uh was found guilty he said well he didnt have any blacks uh you know from his neck of the woods well give me a break you know you know hed have to have his whole family up there for him to feel like hes got his peers or something yeah exactly yeah yeah i mean youre youre in dallas so everybody i cant believe they can uh like in a murder situations they look for juries who dont know anything about the system well or know anything about the the occurrence youd have to be pretty dense yeah youd be in have to be in a cave not to know whats going on or moving it to lubbock or somewhere possibly is not the answer yeah oh theyd have to move it to taiwan for people not to know about it practically this is true so true well this has been an interesting conversation yeah yeah well really this is breaks up my afternoon from changing diapers and mopping floors i mean what can i say no im at home with two little kids preschoolers my husband works for ti oh so youre at the house youre not at the plant oh hold it oh thats good thats good i thought i heard a holler there in the background but i wasnt sure so yeah oh yeah ive got the dog and two kids waiting here i am locked up in the laundry room okay thanks a lot byebye oh goodness well ill let you get i enjoyed it bye 
 okay ellen what kind of a car do you think youre going to buy well as a matter of fact i was thinking about that the other day and uh i really dont know the answer um i would sort of like to uh think about something in the way of uh uh sort of a sporty car but not any not you know a luxury type sporty one but um yeah something that still has a lots of amenities and you know gadgets and things oh you do want a lot of that stuff yeah well yeah i like i like some of those things they come in really handy what kind of uh things are you going to consider you know what uh you said something about the about the well what do you call them you said amenities amenities that they have but what about um their reputation of the company or the price um well of course i guess uh price is always the big consideration but it is for me other people dont seem to have the same problem yeah well thats thats a big one in my book but uh um yeah i have preferences for uh for some um makers over others um and i would sort of like to buy american yeah but you know im not so totally hung up on that that i wouldnt buy something else how about you well um the last car we bought was american because of because of that reason but have not been entirely happy with um several things about the car it doesnt seem like the quality is quite as high as i expected it to be oh really because several things minor things sort of but still they cost us money um that we didnt feel like we should have had to pay on a car that that was that new umhum you know we bought the car new and after um well well well under two years we had to replace the clutch oh and they just said well you know clutches are disposable and i said since when brake pads are disposable you know we know that but i never thought a clutch was disposable yeah yeah yeah i wouldnt have thought so either yeah so that was that was kind of a shock oh oh yeah i i guess theres a lot to to think about when youre trying to make that decision yeah you know the less actually the less you spend on a car it seems like luxury cars theyre called luxury cars even though theyre much more expensive like like uh um a mercedes benz they dont have the history of breaking down or things like that that would go wrong would definitely not be considered disposable right you would never think of having to replace the clutch in a mercedes no but then um especially not after two years no but on the other hand i guess too uh whenever you do have to have some major work done on one of those it costs a fortune really oh i dont know yeah ive uh worked with a couple of people who have owned uh various years uh mercedes and umhum even though they do a lot of the work themselves then just buying the parts and everything is is pretty expensive but for them its its sort of a hobby too to own them yeah what kind of what brand of car are you thinking about buying or like what things are you looking at well i havent really really gotten that far with it um ive always sort of liked general motors a little bit better than some of the others but uh umhum oh i guess i really dont know how come ive been kind of um i guess the commercials are getting to me the toyota commercials and i know that a lot of people ive ive known that have had toyotas have been just extremely happy with them that hardly had any problems at all yeah yeah that i think thats i think they have a really good um quality umhum my uh daughter has owned two different ones and uh you know weve had some work done on them but its not too bad and the reason one of the reasons we um bought the first one was because a friend of ours had a toyota that he just really drove for years and years and years and he lived way out in the country so he put a lot of miles on it umhum and you knew it had had been through a whole lot umhum and yet you know it it held up pretty doggone good so yeah i thought they would they seem to be really durable yeah so i dont know im im not ready to buy a new car yet but i dont know if if the next time im going to try to to stay with buying something american or if im going to go for a little more what i would consider to be a longterm investment yeah well and i guess you know you always have to think about things like your gas mileage and stuff like that you know you oh its easy to get gas mileage in this car it gets excellent gas mileage yeah yeah thats one of the big throwing cards for some of the foreign ones umhum well we talked long enough i think so okay well enjoyed it byebye all righty thanks byebye 
 here goes sharon okay well what do you think about nolan ryan being the first baseball player to earn a million dollars thats the only thing i found out tonight oh you found that out tonight i hadnt even heard that thats great i think he deserves every penny of it yeah yeah but there are some others out there that i dont believe deserve the money theyre getting well isnt it funny how baseballs getting less than like football players would oh yeah wonder because football and they play a lot they play a lot longer season too and a lot more games right yep thats exactly right uhhuh but i think lets see the teams that were there last year were see somebody from california i dont even know who won the pennant last year beats me i mean i know yankees have won a lot of games through the years yeah not lately though we have been talking about this i tried to call earlier uhhuh and we had made a list of all these uh baseball teams and the cities that they were from then i started cleaning and i dont know where i even put that paper i yeah i was just cleaning and throwing threw it away oh gosh lets see the teams that i think the as were in it last year the oakland as and i think it was i dont think it was an all california baseball well have you ever played baseball i play softball well thats what i did when i was growing up yeah that was fun yeah thats fun thats a whole different sport uhhuh yeah lets see but i think i think the rangers need to go and i think the pirates will go and uh lets see rangers have got a new guy this year i dont remember his name either do you ever go see the rangers every once in a while i i like to go on the nights when theres not anybody out there not very many people out there its a lot more fun when youre not fighting a crowd yeah i think its fun i like just looking at the billboards yeah but sometimes when i if you go out there during the day you just fry under the sun yeah its nice at night yeah thats when ive been it is and and do you know anything about that new stadium have you seen all those pictures that theyre going to put out there well no yeah that that huge its suppose to be a huge stadium and its going to have little shopping centers in it and little like a lake or something running through it and uh theyre going to try to make it a real community center out there and youre going to be able to buy your what was no wait of course what was it about the liquor thats thats in uh texas stadium where the football players play was that oh yeah see you just and theyre never going to let liquor in there well theyre trying i know but they try every year and every year they get thrown out its so stupid because they let you take it in there but they dont they dont allow you to sell it dont allow them to sell it

get something else you know and you get tired of that yeah thats typical bureaucracy though thats thats i think its going to be any where you go its just worse in the bigger cities than it is in the smaller ones i dont know sometimes the smaller ones are just as bad yeah well but they cant be though they dont have as much money yeah but the politics the politics gets worse in the small towns sometimes most the time oh man but in dallas you dont even know whos in in administration theres so many of them you dont even know who to payoff huh i mean somebody walks in the classroom and you dont know what theyre there for you know when theyre coming how long theyre going to be yeah oh how funny you know its just them there they are and theyre writing the whole time no communication whatsoever no i had them walk out of my class and not say their name anything and i finally got to where i go okay im debbie moore you know may i ask who you are and what you are in my classroom for

that was a good movie too well do you think weve covered baseball i think so okay well have a good night 
 i cant believe i wrote all that last year acephalous friday 07 may 2010 because ive been grading all damn day and am as tired as a swearengen of hearing other about the finished semesters of pretty much every other academic blogger i thought that it might be best to avoid jealously lashing out and scribble a best of acephalous 2009 post however when i started looking through my archives it occurred to me that my output this year defines me much more sharply than in years past what do i mean the posts i consider foundational to my current professional identity all seem to have been composed in 2009 granted the likelihood that im suffering from the identitarian equivalent of presentism is awfully high but i honestly thought id written some of the posts from early 2009 in 2006 or so it may also be that i remember the scene of their writing which would have been in the old apartment ie the place i barely remember ever having lived in anymore if you have absolutely nothing better to do on a friday night feel free to scan through my 2009 archives and tell me what you think should be included in the best of post if you do have something better to do though by all means do it posted at 0550 pm comments why is someone so young not having fun with friends on a friday night granted grading papers is important but no fun makes for a boring life i should know since when i was your age i had fun playing with my adorable son and caring for another baby you need to try to have a life outside your computer just sayingit seems i have more life now then you have and we know how little i get out posted by alkau saturday 08 may 2010 at 1011 am the one that really stuck in my mind was explaining transitions in the panels of watchmen id read watchmen a short while before and appreciated its narrative complexity but not being used to reading comics hadnt registered all the technical tricks that the artist was using to achieve this the post not only taught me something about the grammar of such images but more importantly led to me realising that there is a grammar to look for in the first place so thanks a lot for that one posted by magistra saturday 08 may 2010 at 0305 pm sek i started going through your back posts and noticed a pattern in my selections so i think it would be easier for me because im rubbish with html to just say all the scene analysis posts and the close reading comics posts like the one magistra mentioned and many others after that plus justifying comics as a legitimate object of study parts i ii i also liked teaching the overdetermined image your takedown of cashill and the whole ayerswrotedreams was excellent and the cruelcrueldeath post you know what im talking about right also the day in actual communist and real nazi history seems as relevant today as ever posted by caio saturday 08 may 2010 at 0649 pm agree with the previous two comments i dont remember if youve made noises here before about turning these into a book but if you do youve got at least one reader posted by martin wisse sunday 09 may 2010 at 0119 am what happened to your post that appeared in my rss reader yesterday posted by tomemos sunday 09 may 2010 at 0916 am would it be possible to arrange your posts into three parties and give your many readers the opportunity to vote for one of them by secret ballot i feel your british readers would appreciate that posted by adam roberts sunday 09 may 2010 at 1057 am 
 wednesday 19 may 2010 the internet occasionally reminds me of how different life is because of it i noted on facebook that from a statistical perspective what makes baseball such an amazing sport is that you can watch it your entire life and still see on a daily basis something youve never seen before its a truism i know but it has the benefit of actually being true in this case the something in question was watching the wonderfully named angel pagan hit an insidethepark home run and initiate a triple play in the same game john emerson responded with some humbug about it not being an insidethepark grand slam which made me remember that i had seen an insidethepark grand slam at some time in the remote past i remember being six or seven years old and watching the mets play the cardinals in an afternoon game at shea stadium and thanks to the miracle of the internet i can definitively say that at approximately 430 pm on 9 june 1985 i watched terry pendleton hit an insidethepark grand slam off joe sambito in a game the cardinals would go on to win handily the fact that i can verify vague memories of events that occurred twentyfive years ago astounds me in a way i sometimes forget the internet is capable of doing this realization is obviously not of worldhistorical importance merely a reminder that this thing whose existence we take for granted daily represents a fundamentally weird complement to human memory the fact that at some point in the future i can know who i rode in an elevator with on 28 december 2005 is less weird because i chose to write about riding in an elevator with grimace that i can access detailed information about events i have no right remembering in detail is another matter entirely joe sambito wow id completely forgotten about him i sometimes wish i could forget that pendelton is the braves hitting coach closest i came to that was watching dale murphy get tagged out at the plate on what would have been an insidethepark slam posted by chuck wednesday 19 may 2010 at 0616 pm he pitched for the astros before he came to the mets stayed for 85 then he pitched for the red sox against the mets in 86 world series i remember him being ineffective and as it turns out he was now that i remember him which i didnt before i remember him as being the pitcher whod pitched for 1 the team the mets faced to get to the 86 series and 2 the one they faced in it i didnt remember that i remember that but now that i do i do memory as gertrude stein would say is funny posted by sek wednesday 19 may 2010 at 0627 pm apparently the drug use sexual excess and weird uci experiences havent softened your brain yet whats really bothersome though is when you only remember things from your distant past my grandpa was alert till the end but when i last saw him at age 92 everything he wanted to talk about was 70 years in the past posted by john emerson wednesday 19 may 2010 at 0702 pm a guess but perhaps your grandfathers life at 22 was more interesting than the ensuing 70 yrs posted by m bouffant wednesday 19 may 2010 at 0854 pm you know what makes this post great no stinking cricket posted by tomemos wednesday 19 may 2010 at 0904 pm yeah i remember sambito from the astros when the braves were in the old nl west because it made sense to have a team 3000 miles from most of their division rivals solid pitcher for a while but burned out toward the end apparently he is a players representative now posted by chuck thursday 20 may 2010 at 1214 pm prosthetic memory posted by endy thursday 20 may 2010 at 0235 pm i like to read about others watching baseball more than i like to watch baseball by a factor of nine having given up on watching the actual sport mention of baseball now only sparks memories of the old man and the sea and the old time baseball writers it is true that at the end of time the old time baseball writers will be hailed as the very best writers as they had access to an event that was susceptible to beautiful writing but horrendous to watch in person plus they smoked a prodigious quantity of cigarettes nota bene an overdue library book is a crime against humanities posted by the library friday 21 may 2010 at 1117 pm 
 the antiterrorist undermining the motivation for terrorism by rev bill mcginnis director loveallpeopleorg this website and everything on it is in the public domain so you may use it freely even without attribution background september 11 2004 three years have now gone by since the september 11th attacks in 2001 and terrorism is a far greater threat to us now than it was then the number and severity of terrorist attacks worldwide has increased dramatically as has the number of active terrorists before 911 terrorism was confined to a small number of extremist individuals loosely linked by radical islam and hatred of israel and its sole supporter the usa now many more moderate muslims have become radicalized worldwide willing to kill innocent civilians in order to achieve their purposes and the serious targets have expanded to include civilians in russia india maylasia the philippines spain and elsewhere as well as israel and its sole supporter the united states true the usa has not suffered a successful major attack since 911 but this does not mean that we are safer the terrorists could strike any time they choose through any of the numerous loopholes so well reported in our media but they have chosen not to attack perhaps because they are waiting to produce an effect even greater than the 911 attacks so they do not appear to be losing strength what could be more spectacular than the 911 attacks nuclear or massive biochemical attack and i think this is what they are waiting for all of our frantic preparations may have had some effect in preventing smalltime casual attacks but they cannot stop a serious planned attack any more than a mere door lock can stop a serious robber who really wants to get into your house so the bush administration can keep claiming that we are safer now under their policies but this claim is merely feelgood propaganda intended to keep the neocons in power it cannot withstand clearheaded scrutiny the fact is bush policies have failed completely even to diminish terrorism much less defeat it by trying to stamp out terrorism by killing terrorists bush and israel have made things infinitely worse for us more dangerous not safer and proof that bush has failed may come at any moment explosively with one big successful attack here in the usa may god help us all what is terrorism terrorism is the systematic use of violence to create a general climate of fear in a population and thereby to bring about a particular political objective source britannicacom httpwwwbritannicacomsearchqueryterrorismct we believe that any terrorist act is a crime against humanity and against the will of god because it deliberately intends to injure and kill innocent people neutralizing terrorism our purpose here is to neutralize terrorism by removing the motivation for it without motivation terrorism will quickly die down like a plant without water we completely reject the idea that terrorism can be defeated by brute force because brute force radicalizes the moderates and they then join the terrorists so you end up fighting the entire population brute force has failed in palestine and it is failing in iraq we try to be evenhanded in opposing all terrorism although we recognize that the greatest terrorist threat in the world today comes from radical muslims who falsely believe that allah approves of their criminal behavior against israel the united states russia india the philippines australia and others whom they falsely believe to be waging war against allah and the secondgreatest terrorist threat comes from several countries mainly israel who sometimes resort to terrorism themselves claiming selfdefense as they desperately try to prevent further attacks by radical muslims in all of these cases above if the radical muslims would cease their attacks all terrorism on both sides of every dispute would quickly end beyond these two sources there is virtually no terrorist activity in the world with the possible exception of localized disputes such as in northern ireland and occasional domestic episodes in various places involving isolated disaffected groups the moral and religious theories which support terrorism are quite faulty and erroneous they need to be identified and attacked if the terrorist loses faith in the righteousness of his acts he is less likely to perform them example 1 terrorists offend allah example 2 terrorist murderers insult allah bring shame to islam example 3 latest and best framed below quran forbids terrorism in every case of terrorism we will find some kind of legitimate underlying grievance if we eliminate the legitimate grievances we have eliminated much of the motivation is this negotiating with terrorists or trying to appease the terrorists as some israelineocons would try to say no it is simply recognizing the realities of human motivation right or wrong to deny reality as the israelineocons do is to invite disaster as they have done

accusation on kos today that the audience is laughing at christine odonnell on the first thing she says but i disagree entirely on that point her supporters are laughing at coons its absolutely a shes got you dumbass laugh the sort of ohnoshediint laugh youd hear from a studio audience when the slightly stupid but affable and hitherto ineffective dunce character finally gets a zinger in on the handsome lead remember that at least half the audience in a venue like this would be there to support odonnell and the point to separation of church and state in the constitution dig is a virulently popular meme in the loonosphere from whence comes the teabagger political playbook those are hoots and calls of support for odonnell supposedly putting one over on coons they arent laughing at her there may very well have been a gasp and some uncomfortable okay thats enough now chuckles at the end but the guffaws at the top of the clip are with her not at her posted by elding at october 19 2010 252 pm hilarious posted by adx at october 19 2010 300 pm i dont think the audience is laughing at coons the laughter has an incredulous ohmygod sound to it but its obvious that odonnell thinks theyre laughing at him not her when she hears the reaction she looks out at the audience with a big proud grin she thinks she just scored mucho points on baldy elding is right separation of church and state isnt in the constitution is a major wingnut talking point they routinely claim that the establishment of religion clause doesnt mean what everyone else thinks it means so although this shows what an extremist nut odonnell is its not really a gaffe its standard stuff right out of their playbook posted by steve8489 at october 19 2010 304 pm well if one is looking for the phrase separation of church and state yeah thats not in there so tada yay looks at me i wins a big arguments and i poops my pants but the principle is in there i love when ignorant fucks like odonnell and her little orcling hordes make huge category mistakes like this its is akin to taking a tour of a college and starting it off at the administration offices and when that part of the tour is finished someone like odonnell says ok thats great but when are we gonna start seeing the college posted by at october 19 2010 310 pm yes its standard stuff and her crowd would have springboarded off of it thats what im saying as far as shes concerned its not a gaffe and as far as her supporters in the room are concerned it was not only not a gaffe it was a direct hit they should have applauded that would have settled this matter for good im convinced thats not laughing at her thats ooo good one for her posted by elding at october 19 2010 311 pm well elding its already being reported that it was her that was clueless so coons gets the last laugh on that posted by allonfla at october 19 2010 330 pm i dont believe this was a public event elvis i think it was a debate before the students at the law school i mean it could be some of her supporters infiltrated but i truly believe there wouldve been lots of catcalling etc if that were the case posted by pea at october 19 2010 330 pm yeah pea you have a point there but still the laughter doesnt sound incredulous to me it sounds appreciative and snarky put yourself in a nonpartisan law school student position would you laugh at loud at a teabagger meme like the one she dropped or would you muttergrumble to yourself whispering to your colleague what a fucking idiot i dont see a crowd like that laughing out loud at such a pitiful little meme its not even worth a laughoutloud guffaw posted by elding at october 19 2010 353 pm well keep in mind that all of them probably know what a freak she is i think it might be more of a holy crap i cant believe she just topped all the other stupid shit shes said and i got to bear witness to it laughter i know if i had the opportunity to attend a sarah palin rally id be overjoyed to hear some incredible stupid falling out of her mouth posted by pea at october 19 2010 407 pm which would be uh any sarah palin rally also posted by pea at october 19 2010 408 pm elding the debate was at a law school you really think lawyers are going to laugh at coons rather than odonnell not a snowballs chance in hell posted by nicole473 at october 19 2010 500 pm excerpts from httptinyurlcom26ddbvd you actually audibly heard the crowd gasp widener university political scientist wesley leckrone said after the debate adding that it raised questions about odonnells grasp of the constitution erin daly a widener professor who specializes in constitutional law said that while there are questions about what counts as government promotion of religion there is little debate over whether the first amendment prohibits the federal government from making laws establishing religion she seemed genuinely surprised that the principle of separation of church and state derives from the first amendment and i think to many of us in the law school that was a surprise daly said its one thing to not know the 17th amendment or some of the others but most americans do know the basics of the first amendment odonnell didnt respond to reporters who asked her to clarify her views after the debate posted by bigben at october 19 2010 548 pm anyone who says evolution is only a theoryits not a fact is so stupid so utterly fucking brainless uneducated ignorant clueless and unread they should immediately be sterilized on the slim chance that theres a genetic component to their imbecility anyone who stubbornly knows so little about science cannot possibly be expected to develop the analytical skills necessary to interpret con law posted by cousinavi at october 19 2010 550 pm if the laughter was with her then the joke is on everyone there in support of course because moments later after shes basically pounding the desk talking about the constitution and her unyielding devotion to that which does not separate church and statehaha she cant recall the 14th and 16th amendments and needs to be refreshed by the questioner thats the real busted moment here if you ask me for people who speak so militantly about adhering to the constitution i expect a military like response to such a simple question wingnuts will turn blue arguing about a christian nation and constitution but not knowing two amendments as a person running to uphold and defend the constitution containing those amendments this clip exposes her and the tea party faithful as constitutional frauds not knowing what the constitution says when asked is bold font black over white theres no grey area here as a defender you can say well she believes church and state are indivisible so do i but you cant say she knows the constitution when she clearly does not as someone trying to get a government job with great benefits where the qualification is basically take this constitution and defend it with your life tea party republicans spend an awful lot of time tearing it up and reassembling the pieces to their acquired tastes her argument dismissing the separation of church and state is dessert before dinner slightly offtopic ive been spending a lot of time on potential swing vote forums adding fact to fiction its hilarious when republicans who voted for bush twice and approved the majority of the way throughapproval among republicans was pretty consistentare telling me about all the mistakes obama makes and imparting their bushloving wisdom to those less intheknow if you think bush was good enough to vote for twice and youre one of the 60 million mccainpalin people your qualifications and insight like christine odonnells are comical at best make no mistake im laughing at you tea party

hear a mans voice say oh my god after odonnell says that and his tone is i cant believe she said something so incredibly stupid yeah they were laughing at her as is appropriate posted by irish girl at october 19 2010 553 pm its beyond frustrating to me as someone who has studied constitutional law who competed on the the national level on it in law school and who published an article on it to hear people who clearly havent done the first of these talk about it as if they know better than i do what the constitution says means and is all about i had a tper over at huffpo tell me i didnt know what i was talking about visvis the need for constitutional interpretation and constitutional law he believed that any and all constitutional questions must and can only be resolved by amendment not by judicial review before proudly proclaiming that he had never gone to law school and despised the legal profession where do you go from there posted by grafzeppelin127 at october 19 2010 641 pm i thinks this illustrates their biblical view of the constitution and by that i mean they regard it the same way as they regard the holy bible its a document that is not to be questioned but merely followed to the letter because it was handed down to us by greater beings oh and like the holy bible that we mere mortals are not supposed to question or interpret theyll let us know what it really means and that will often conflict with what it actually says they try to exert some sort of control over its meaning by elevating it to a level that makes it untouchable to them its not a living document that was designed to change with the nation but essentially carved in stone like the ten commandments immutable and unchanging except for you know maybe an amendment barring gay marriage but in order to regain some control over their lives that they firmly believe theyve lost theyre now trying to determine with unwavering certainty that weve all been doing this wrong the whole time and if we just get back to what the founders wanted everything will be ok give em a few minutes though theyre waiting on an email reply from the washington reenacter at arlington to hand down some decisions posted by nanotyrannus at october 19 2010 719 pm grafzeppellin127 in answer to your question where do you go from there ive recently come to the conclusion that the answer is nowhere i used to be against making blanket statements about the hard core tea partiers like the person you describedtheyre not all crazy theyre not all hateful but lately im over it they dont believe in evolution climate change the dept of education public education taxes in order to pay for roadspolice and firemen they believe the president is not an american they see no problem with racism sexism and fascism they dont understand that freedom of speech doesnt mean freedom from consequences they confuse losing an election with tyranny they horde food because glenn beck told them so they conflate their movement with the civil rights movement they detain reporters on public property for the crime of asking questions you dont reason with people who believe these things any more than youd try to reason with charles manson theyre crazy plain and simple and its really really sad posted by mslarry1973 at october 19 2010 723 pm elding have to disagree buddy the debate was at widener law school they laughed at her the second time as well when she incredulously asked as if not believing coons thats in the first amendment i dont think they were laughing at him if they were theyd be reacting after his comment and probably booing and calling him a liar rather than reacting after her comment posted by broadway carl at october 19 2010 723 pm irish girlso good to see you i hope youre well posted by nicole473 at october 19 2010 759 pm grafzeppelin i had a tper over at huffpo tell me i didnt know what i was talking about visvis the need for constitutional interpretation and constitutional law he believed that any and all constitutional questions must and can only be resolved by amendment not by judicial review before proudly proclaiming that he had never gone to law school and despised the legal profession there is nowhere to go with these ignoramuses they would not believe you if you parted the sea for them first i learned my lesson at hp while it can be personally satisfying to present all your little ducks in a row they will never stop erroneously knocking the damn ducks out of line posted by nicole473 at october 19 2010 802 pm you know she had better watch out the separation between church and state is what saves us from sharia law i think those trying to diminish the separation are probably secret muslim sympathizers that are sneaking sharia law in on us posted by ron spridgen at october 19 2010 817 pm nah im convinced that the audible gasps and stifled chuckles were from her attempt to bluff her way through an exchange regarding the constitution in a room full of lawyers performance art people shes not running to win and if you think she is youre not paying attention posted by lexaburn at october 19 2010 1058 pm think of those bill maher clips the constant television appearances for the last decade or so think of who endorsed her and how odonnell could teach her a thing or two aboutmoderate adlibbing the strategy is this be as foolish as possible so no one anticipates you actually knowing anything embrace the derision andor ridicule go on the circuit as a passionate advocate for whatever cause you choose to coopt in odonnells case its the same pseudochristianity holy rollers dignify to play within the political arena in palins case its the cryptofascism that oozes within the gop the teapublicans fool no one with their talk of independence and the theatrical infighting they always tame those they let in their ranks or they destroy them palin knows her place as do they all do you really think a serious candidate would go around asking for hints during a debate seriously odonnell is not that stupid i know some of you want to think she is for the sake of mirth and merriment but she aint sorry just like palin isnt stupid enough to confuse pa with wv poke fun all you want but at least be realistic with yourselves you have just as much fun as theyre having trust me yall they are faking it odonnells running on personality alone nothing more nothing less regarding politics shes a glorified booster same as with mangle in nevada lowden the chickenlady and mangle were merely supposed to challenge and beat reid then get out of the way odonnell is to be a face for the underdog teabaggers this is why theyre not making a full investment in her her place is not in the senate but on television posted by lexaburn at october 19 2010 1117 pm elvis having watching the video several times i have to disagree the audience was clearly laughing at her and her ignorance however she clearly thinks she that she has scored a huge win and that the audience was on her side just more of her complete separation from reality posted by dc at october 19 2010 1123 pm oh and elding their reaction stems from the fact that she broached the subject again after the moderator moved on her question was the equivalent of asking wherere the pictures when staring at the document especially in that setting she did it on purpose not to further the discussion but to establish that yes she is a dependable dumbass im telling you all shes running a game posted by lexaburn at october 19 2010 1124 pm lexaburn i have to disagree with your assessment that this is all a game and that shes not that dumb i dont believe shes as dumb as she is ignorant it if really is a game for odonnell then whats the end game she may have flown under the radar for her previous campaigns but now shes made herself a fool in the national spotlight and effectively ruined any chance of continuing her charade if her intention was to be a lifelong nominee in the first place being a perpetual campaigner can only get you so far and if they dont intend to win after getting the nomination then that con game is limited maybe palin fits more into the realm of your assessment but if she runs and loses in 2012 her shelf life is limited too posted by broadway carl at october 20 2010 1229 am nicole hi its good to be back ive been awol due to having a babylittle liam was born on 921 a couple of weeks early but hes doing well thank goodness for fmla and maternity leave posted by irish girl at october 20 2010 108 am bc you misunderstand me im not saying she knows a damned thing about the constitution in fact id go a far as to say she doesnt give one damn about it what im saying is that going into these discussions shes fully aware of her deficiencies to tell the truth i cant tell you her actual endgame per se but if i had a guess it would be an extended stint on a cable news channel the shelf life of both women is only limited to the fraction with which they uphold a standard palin took standards out of the equation when she quit her job were she to actually run it would be for vanitys sake shes reaching for what odonnell has already achieved theyve both lowered themselves to being cheerleaders for socalled conservative causes well palin did anyway i attribute part of my assessment of odonnell to info ive gleaned from a good friend of mine that knew her on the media circuit at the start of the decade my friend describes her as a bad actress primarily that coopts conservativism but doesnt necessarily cling to it as some may believe this friend tells me that christine doesnt believe half provocative andor boneheaded things shes saying odonnell is described as a normal conservative republican woman by my friend i am convinced personally that odonnells just a starved media personality that found a new gimmick in running for public office that is the lifestyle choice she has made and shes sticking with it some of the innuendo surrounding her leads me to this conclusion as well however i cant be too conclusive you know what im being too much of a stuffy doctor anyway that smile she gives after asking about the 1st amendment may very well be her being in on the joke shes making of herself its not the fact that she tried and failed to dictate content within a constitutional amendment its the fact that she knew she did not know and said what she said regardless do not try to make sense out of anything of this if youre not thinking like acelebrity of whatever quality lets say heres what you do gather all the odonnell appearances that you can from online sources go through all and see if her point of view ever evolves beyond the conservative blather or the crank conspiracy theories next ask yourself why she continues to be invited to these public forums what exactly is she adding to these conversations in all my cable news watching ive seen far more dim characters than odonnell with regular gigs so its not the fact that shes dumb that gets her on television my friend tells me of certain connections individuals like odonnell have that gets them the leeway they need to raise their public profile since they really have no one to answer to they can go on television and say anything get away with it and do it again in yet another televised venue its a perpetual cycle shes not campaigning to win anything im telling you bc you see how rove immediately rejected her i dont believe that was because she beat the establishment candidate in fact my theory is that rove wasnt so much as rejecting her as limiting her role within the media environment im thinking shes aiming to be on fnc on a regular basis this all comes from my observing her debate performances as well as her more recent tv appearances shes not so much running for office as she is auditioning to be a regular voice for the cons a reaffirmation of sorts shes been at this for a while and they have younger more loopier and dimwitted con tarts traipsing about palins taking time away from them but she has her own plans which have yet to be revealed though they may be all too obvious posted by lexaburn at october 20 2010 342 am christine odonnell is certainly ignorant in the sense that while perfectly aware that there are many things she doesnt know she is clueless as to how that might be an impediment its an odd combination knowing you dont really have a solid grasp on a subject but still being convinced that ones core principals are enough to overcome any obstacle odonnell believes in the bible shes a jesus freak and thats enough for her odonnell is opposed to anything liberal anything progressive anything obama anything democrat anything that can in any way be determined not to accord with the demands of her savior and lord jesus christ as she interprets his word in any way and thats enough for her the only reason shes a republican tea party gangster is because her brand of theocracy and batshit stupidity would simply never fly anywhere else in the stumped frustrated hypocritcal idiocy of the extreme right in that gang of redneck ignoramuses who want simple answers to complex questions they do not understand she finds the only market for her brand of incompetent yammering facts dont matter evidence doesnt matter history doesnt matter just look at the clips bill maher runs of her blithering insistent certainty she pisses off everyone all the time and never once not a single time ever stops long enough to even consider that maybe shes the one who doesnt get it its they who dont get it the constitutional lawyers dont know fuck all about the constitution she does because she took a week long course at oxford university that she lies about her academic credentials inflates beyond all reason and truth the actual degree of study she has accomplished does not in any way diminish her insistence that she is highly educated really very knowledgeable about all of these things she doesnt know about richard dawkins doesnt know anything about the theory of evolutionhes just a cranky atheist she read a pamphlet from the discovery institute that totally explains the difference between creationism and intelligent designwhich are not the same things not at all and anyone who says they are is just wrong especially that court in dover that found as a matter of fact that the id crowd simply used find replace to substitute intelligent design for creation resulting in numerous instances of intelligent designism but fuck it everyone is wrong christine odonnell is right and if you disagree with her then you are properly an object of scorn and derision for being so poorly informed about things it may not be campaigning to win she may well know that shes unelectable but in her mind thats because the voters have been brainwashed by the same evil wrongheaded liberal progressive indoctrination that has corrupted our schools our leaders and our society christine odonnell doesnt have a hidden agenda she sees herself as morally correct profoundly right in both senses of the term and struggling as only a jebus loving martyr can against the tide of evil sweeping her nation as for why she consistently gets to appear on television shes fuckable in that weird sarah palin way that makes me recoil in horror and wonder what the fuck is wrong with anyone who would touch those women with their worst enemys cock shell say apeshit nuts things about masturbation and flirting with witchcraft and insist that these things that she knows things no one else knows like the top secret information about chinas plans to take over the usa to which only she is privy places her in the unique position to lecture obama on con law henry kissinger on foreign policy history richard dawkins on evolution lawrence krause on cosmology and murray gellmann on particle physics she knows things see jebus tells her things frankly i think its the result of the move in the 70s and 80s to tell students that they were all special that no one was any better or any smarter than anyone else that everyone has a right to their own opinion to make sure that everyone who played the game got a trophy now those selfinflated selfimportant selfesteem fiddled crowd are running for office and they are fucking well convinced that they do know as much as anyone else and their opinions about things are just as valid as anyone elseseven moreso because its my opinionand who are you to tell me that i dont know what im talking about you dont know what youre talking about knowing shes going to lose is not the same thing as running to lose in the same way that knowing she really doesnt know much about the constitution will never prevent her from telling you what it must mean she thinks shes right today and she will think shes right after being stomped to death at the polls she will continue to blither her vacuous bullshit on any platform she can find spend campaign money on her rent and go to bed every night feeling as though she is fighting the good fight for jebus truth and america posted by cousinavi at october 20 2010 443 am lex thanks for the clarification it looks like you might have an inside track into this persons make up but im still going to think that her smile wasnt so much that shes in on the joke as it was she really does think she knows what shes talking about it is a debate after all a competition to just shrug your shoulders and throw a hail mary pass with a smile on your face would be suicidal but really who the hell knows posted by broadway carl at october 20 2010 956 am avi i agree with you completely except that i believe the everyone is special crowd started in the 90s i grew up in the 70s and there were no gifted programs for kids who didnt happen to drool on themselves back then the entitlement because i deserve it generation is currently in their early to mid 20s my wife deals with them all the time at her place of

 fermentation the daily wine blog eminent domain used to usurp wine label real estate i was disappointed though not surprised to see that today a conjunctive labeling law dictating that sonoma county be placed on every label on wines produced from grapes grown in sonoma county was unanimously passed by the california legislature pushed as an effort to promote sonoma county wines and a consumer education effort the new law instead forces vintners to needlessly sully their package and undermines their own marketing efforts yet the law does nothing to educate consumers passed unanimously out of the california assembly and senate ab 1798 now awaits the governors signature which it will surely obtain according to noreen evans an assembly sponsor of the bill this new conjunctive labeling law requires that any wine labeled with an american viticultural area ava located entirely within sonoma county like russian river valley or dry creek valley must also include the word sonoma county on the label starting in 2014 there are 13 avas in sonoma county the problem of course is that by placing the words sonoma county on a bottle of wine that is made with grapes grown in russian river valley dry creek valley sonoma valley or any other ava in sonomasonoma county have any single distinguishing feature derived from the fact that they were grown inside the borders of sonoma county county consumers learn absolutely nothing about the wine in the bottle there no evidence that grapes grown in assemblywoman evans concludes by improving consumer education on each bottle conjunctive labeling will unleash the full potential of our delicious wines to represent sonoma around the world shes correct beginning in 2014 sonoma county will receive a tremendous boost in recognition due to the conjunctive labeling law that forces vintners to add more wording to their labelswhether they think the words sonoma county help or hurt their marketing efforts frankly if i was making high end wine from the sonoma valley sonoma mountain or sonoma coast avas that depended in part on the quality recognition that comes wtih these avas id be pissed that im forced now to put a placename on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the wine behind my label and in some cases demonstrably lowered its perceived quality honore comfort executive director of the sonoma county vintners association and an outstanding representative for sonoma county wines noted this this moment marks the beginning of a stronger sonoma county brand for generations to come proponents of the new sonoma county conjunctive labeling law like to point to a similar law that demands napa valley be placed on all wines that are made from grapes grown in that appellation rather than simply using a sub appellation they point to the prestige that the napa valley designation carries but this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands napa valley in addition to simply rutherford be placed on these wines it has to do entirely with the promotional effort that has gone into making napa valley a place associated with great wines such an association will not be made with sonoma county winesever the vintners in sonoma county simply cant make a case for sonoma county having any meaning or for a region as vast as sonoma county delivering any degree of quality to the grapes why is it important for someone making sonoma coast pinot noir or sonoma valley zinfandel to help promote sonoma county a designation that has no ability to define the quality or character of the wines in my sonoma coast pinot noir or my sonoma valley zinfandel this is an example of a county usurping the private label real estate and its very valuable real estate for the sake of promoting something that is of little use to private commercial interests ask yourselfif putting the words sonoma county on ones wines was such a great thing why dont more vintners who make dry creek valley russian river valley alexander valley or sonoma valley wines already put these words on their label they legally couldif they wanted to the new sonoma county conjunctive labeling law is the equivalent of the state of california and the county of sonoma claiming imminent domain over the labels of hundreds of vintners comments nick perdiew said i love it tom you found a way to tie this in nicely this is a case of overreaching government regulation costing business unnecessarily and burdening them with more regulations its just unnecessary it also is a social promotion in the sense that great sonoma wines that now are forced to use sonoma county will be giving some of their credibility to their lesser neighbors shades of wealth redistribution as well ew ew ew august 30 2010 at 1144 am james mccann said how many hundreds or thousands of labels will have to be resubmitted to the ttb between now and 2014 august 30 2010 at 1159 am john kelly said id be pissed that im forced now to put a placename on my label that told my buyers nothing of real value about the wine behind my label and in some cases demonstrably lowered its perceived quality exactly tom and i am really pissed and so is every other producer i have discussed this issue with i still dont know whose interests are being served by this useless piece of crap legislation i completely agree with you when you state such an association will not be made with sonoma county winesever duh ive got real skin in this game we are going to have to totally redesign our front label to make room for sonoma county and so far every mockup is cluttered and decreases the impact of our brand our best option looks like we will go to north coast or california for our front label appellation and discuss the grape source vineyard name and meaningful ava on the back label who is going to compensate me for this i estimate the value to be in six figures and we are a small winery for a larger winery with a betterestablished brand the value is much higher eminent domain is exactly right this is nothing less than governmental taking the legislators who backed this should be ashamed they should also expect to lose my vote for them next election august 30 2010 at 1204 pm hardy wallace said thanks tom this law is such bs august 30 2010 at 1220 pm johnlopresti said i put in 1 decades in trade coursework and several branches of the industry i support the new labeling requirement sonoma county always was the sheep ranch joke in the era of napas welldeserved early global fame sonoma county now is as good or better than those early napa vintages together we have led the world into modern viticulture with the help of uc davis and in some pretty good company from other regions i suppose the new law is all sacramento hype but i think it will improve northcoast revenue and dignity i admit i have voted for the bills authoress when i was a kid in a county called solano not too famous for wines or avas people sometimes would happen by our place asking where rte 37 was where was black pt people always were confused how the somewhat neighboring counties had such similar names now after several decades in sonoma county i have learned to appreciate its uniqueness for its viticulture and other industries the town of sonoma is on a typical route people follow driving from solano county to sonoma county the ambience in the town sonoma is only an enclave it is rightfully proud of its heritage as a village and for its viticultural traditions but sonoma county encompasses much more territory and other avas within the county are starkly different from the characteristics of sonoma valley and the town of sonoma aint many people still overseeing vineyard blends vive la nouveau sonoma county august 30 2010 at 0124 pm nick perdiew said in to johnlopresti john good of you to comment and good to have dissent what do you make of the fact that vintners already are free to put sonoma county on any label they want govt cannot mandate marketing effectiveness anymore than it can mandate perception of quality if it were effective wouldnt you already see it virtually everywhere i admit i dont see the reasoning of your argument here the issue of the costs to vintners is nontrivial too as you can see above august 30 2010 at 0204 pm bill cadman said tom i wonder what the response would be in napa and sonoma if the vintners in fresno convinced the state government to require california be put on all labels of wine made within california august 31 2010 at 1040 am johnlopresti said these past few years eminent domain has become a libertarian property rights flashpoint since the kelo v new london ct case concerning urban renewal polemics i can see tom ws concerns too there was a counterpoint in the label world after some court cases resulted in a companys revising its grape sourcing to comply with tightened requirements for 75 incounty fruit in order to remain legal in designating the wine as from napa one rambling articles author counted 16 occurrences of the word napa on the newly designed label of a famous budget wine producers 2005 napa cabernet sauvignon august 31 2010 at 0204 pm

government what terminology goes on wine labels those concerns belong to the federal govt and the ttb which already mandates in fairly exhaustive detail what goes on front and back labels and how can the state legislature single out two counties first napa now sonoma for this treatment are they going to go through the wineproducing counties one by one august 31 2010 at 0223 pm johnlopresti said

highlands thinking the scot might have interest in playing the bagpipes in the uplands then at steves site there is an interesting discussion of his current ongoing efforts with blends from carneros and sonoma coast its easy to get lost in nomenclatures when one is striving for new concepts in a way all this tries to approach terroir from a slight distance plus the historical distinctions between the two premium distinctive varietal regions napa county and sonoma county winkler heat summation datapoints also clarified several decades ago some of the plant physiologic underpinnings of why napa county and sonoma county were the natural leaders in premium winegrape production there are many reasons why the new labeling requirement makes sense from all these perspectives september 01 2010 at 0422 pm johnlopresti said sorry i keep forgetting the fermentation sites html protocol here is the oivv label guideline link again httpnewsreseauconceptnetimagesoivukclientoivwinelabellingstandarden2006pdf september 01 2010 at 0425 pm el jefe said ok so heres the real requirement any wine labeled with an american viticultural area established yada yada that is located entirely within yada yada shall bear the designation sonoma county on the label in a type size not smaller than two millimeters on containers of more than 187 milliliters or smaller than one millimeter on containers of 187 milliliters or less if i recall correctly this is almost exactly the same as the requirement for the government warning type size so the answer seems pretty clear to me just add sonoma county to the government warning september 01 2010 at 0500 pm johnonwine said they honore comfort and the sonoma county vintners point to the prestige that the napa valley designation carries but this prestige has nothing to due with the law that demands napa valley in addition to simply rutherford be placed on these wines it has to do entirely with the promotional effort that has gone into making napa valley a place associated with great wines such an association will not be made with sonoma county winesever tom i would suggest that all napa wineries good and bad benefit from having napa valley on the label it is indeed a great example of marketing what you describe as promotional effort perhaps the proponents of the law are not doing the job they were hired to do perhaps the scv needs a more passionate communicator on their marketing team putting together the quality promotion you suggest is impossible sonoma county with roughly half of the wineries of napa county wins roughly twice as many gold medals in national and international wine competitions that the fact that their wines cost less on average and the wineries are friendlier less snooty is a compelling story to get out to the public heck if folks knew all that maybe folks would be seeking out bottles with sonoma county on the label you suggest that this is a bad law that sonoma county will never be associated with high quality wine in the way napa county is i disagree but i am eternally hopeful optimistic that the sonoma county vintners will inject a little passion and not more of the same old staid and boring in their marketing communications i have confidence they will change retool improve live up to their responsibilities i worked selling and marketing sonoma county wines i won awards for my marketing efforts the story is simple people are receptive to it selling the magic of sonoma county wines is easy thats my take anyway i dont aim to be contrarian but i dont mind being the sole supporter of the law as a sonoma county born and bred wine guy september 03 2010 at 0821 pm 
 hr 5034 the lies the facts the fictions with so much at stake for americas alcohol wholesalers and their protected monopoly status that props up unearned profits its no surprise they would swing for the fences with all their stategranted political power and attempt to pass hr 5034 this bill currently in congress would give wholesaler lobbyists the means to turn back the clock on consumer access to wine lead to the passage of laws that override federal regulations on alcohol kill jobs and business that focus on artisan production of wine beer and spirits punish and dismantle small specialty wine retailers that serve the consumers that wholesalers wont and override the critical constitutional principle of a single american economic unionall for the sake of protecting wholesaler profits by giving them unprecedented control and influence over the entire american alcohol industry but what is truly remarkable and likely a result of the wholesalers hubris stemming from 75 years of being granted government welfare is their willingness to misrepresent facts ignore the truth and mislead in their defense of hr 5034 the recently launched wwwhr5034org website is the creation of the national beer wholesalers association and and appears to be the repository all the misrepresentation ignorance and misleading ideas supporters of hr 5034 could possibly muster for the sake of context and setting the record straight this post address many of the misrepresentations and misleading claims made at the middlemens disingenuous new website on their homepage httpwwwhr5034org todays system balances competition with public safety to ensure that consumers can enjoy alcohol without suffering the negative effects of an unregulated marketplace is there really any competition when the statebased regulatory system the wholesalers love so much require that producers of alcohol use a wholesaler to bring their goods to market meaning that without use of a wholesaler a producer cannot enter a states market it also means that wholesalers get to decide what consumers drink not consumers unfortunately the effective statebased regulatory system in the us is under attack over the past 10 yearsmore than 25 states have faced challenges in federal courts to their authority to regulate alcohol and their ability to maintain a licensed system of alcohol controls the only challenges to the statebased alcohol regulatory system are those that discriminate against interstate commerce for protectionist reasons even in the wake of successful suits that challenged the protectionist laws that wholesalers originally pushed the state retained extraordinarily broad authority to maintain a robust system of alcohol controls on the learn more page httpwwwhr5034orglearnmore litigation against the states brought by those wishing to deregulate alcohol for their own economic interests is of great concern to state alcohol regulators state attorneys general public health advocates and many otherswhen the economic interests of producers retailers and consumers are horsewhipped by states doing the bidding of wholesales who receive more government protection and welfare from the state than any other industry in america you might expect them to fight back as for those that have concern lets recall that its only a tiny fraction of state alcohol regulators that there is no formal support from state attorneys general only a mere handful of public health advocates a selection of recipients of campaign contributions from wholesalers and wholesalers themselves that support hr 5034 according to a recent national poll conducted by the center for alcohol policy 79 of respondents support the right of individual states to set their own laws and regulations surrounding the sale of alcohol and 87 agree that state and local laws regarding alcohol regulations should be decided by lawmakers and citizens not by judges im shocked shocked i say that the center for alcohol policy is an arm of the national beer wholesalers association and that it would conduct a poll that finds results supporting those that funded the poll does it get any more illegitimate on the fact v fiction page httpwwwhr5034orgfactvsfiction fact this bill does not address direct shipping or any specific state alcohol law it does not preempt a state law that allows direct shipping it does not mandate a direct shipping law where there currently is not one the bill does protect a states wine shipping law if someone were to challenge it in court by providing the shipping law with the same presumption of validity granted other state alcohol lawsdisingenuous in the extreme and whats worse the wholesalers knew this when they wrote this hr 5034 gives states the ability to pass laws unchallengeable in court that would discriminate against outofstate wine shippers and we know such laws would be introduced into various states since wholesalers have seen to it that such laws have been introduced into state legislatures for the past 20 years in fact hr 5034 would allow states to pass laws that make consumers receipt of a wine by instate shippers legal while making receipt of a wine by outofstate shippers punishable to a greater degree than rape home invasion or selling cocaine to children fact protection of a states power to regulate alcohol is not an industry food fight food fight may be the wrong word better to call the introduction of hr 5034 what it is an attack on the entire alcohol industry and consumers for the sake of protecting wholesaler profits its no coincidence that brewers large and small wineries spirit producers and importers retailers wine education organizations wine consumers and free trade organizations all oppose hr 5034 this bill does not amend or alter the federal alcohol administration act faa act which provides federal guidelines in many of these areas no it doesnt amend the faa act it overrides it entirely to quote from hr 5034 not withstanding that the state or territorial law may burden interstate commerce or an act of congress the state law shall be upheld this claim by the wholesalers that hr 5034 does not amend federal regulations on alcohol is a straight up misrepresentation its like saying i didnt kick the dog but rather his ribs fell on to my boot it is the intent of this language to make clear the congressional support for the holding in granholmprohibiting state laws that allow an instate winery to do something a similarly situated outofstate winery cannot do language that bars facial discrimination is included in the bill to codify this prohibition i have great faith in the wholesalers ability to mislead but this goes beyond even my expectation the intent of hr 5034 is precisely to overturn the granholm v heald supreme court decision that did away with protectionist state alcohol laws more importantly the very language of hr 5034 gives states the explicit right to discriminate against outofstate wine shippers all the state needs to do is offer the feeblest of justifications read for yourself state or territorial regulations may not facially discriminate without justification against outofstate producers of alcoholic beverages in favor of instate producers one of those justifications the bill states is maintenance of the structure of the state alcoholic beverage distribution system in other words discrimination is ok as long as the discrimination is written into the states alcohol beverage distribution laws furthermore note that wine retailers are not even covered by this duplicitous language on justification the state needs no justification to discriminate against outofstate retailers over half the states have been sued challenging their alcohol laws the lawsuits have attacked items such as commonsense safeguards that require a facetoface transaction needed for id checks to buy alcohol in fact facetoface transactions are not needed for id checks we know this because states have written laws that have gone unchallenged that require id checks to be made at the point of delivery of the wine unelected judges should not set alcohol policy this responsibility rightly rests with individual state legislatures as guaranteed under the 21st amendment to the us constitution judges never have set policy state legislatures always have this is the big lie the wholesalers tell judges merely tell the state when they have reached beyond what the 21st amendment allows after that the state legislatures in every state where litigation has affected badly crafted laws went about legislating a fix surely the wholesalers dont mean to say that state alcohol laws should in no way be required to abide by the principles in the us constitution what next will the wholesalers argue the 21st amendment give the states the right to prohibit women from buying alcohol will they argue that state laws banning africanamericans from being distributors is legal under the 21st amendment state laws that raise concerns can and should be addressed in the state legislature lucky for americans it wasnt this attitude that ruled the day when jim crow laws were in place the wholesalers would have argued that the racist separate but equal philosophy had no business being litigated and that we should wait for the legislatures that enacted the racist laws to overturn them with new laws we have courts precisely to adjudicate concerns with the fairness and constitutionality of state laws but of course wholesalers know this they to have brought states to court over alcohol distribution laws they didnt think were fair or constitutional it appears that wholesalers dont like the courts involved when the decision dont go their way the hypocrisy misleading notions and disinformation being featured at the wholesalers website supporting hr 5034 is staggering however they do the right thing when they invite readers to sign up for emails that will deliver the latest developments i urge all readers to sign up for those emails in the mean time please checkout the website that spurred the wholesalers to launch their own httpwwwstophr5034org it is published by the specialty wine retailers association and upon reading through it you should find yourself feeling much cleaner and less soiled than after wading through the misrepresentations of the new wholesalersponsored website

my pleasure july 16 2010 at 0942 am bill sprow said get rid of thewe beer and wine distributor associations ie make them illegal and you would really be showing a free market work in progress if i as

passionate polemic a foreceful and sorely needed rebuttal to a bogus bill july 19 2010 at 0910 am tom said seems like some old geezers are filling their pockets with some major greenbacks getting this bill passed through its a blatant anticompetition bill that will crush the uniqness of the alchoholwine industry kinda like wal mart moving into a town and crushing the boutique shops since i live in texas ill have to resort to buying odouls and welchs grape juice after the baptists take control of the law in the state legislature dont even get me started on the still enacted blue laws of this state cant buy liqour on sundays july 19 2010 at 0912 am r said wow i am speechless i will not even waste my time rebutting you point by point because you do not have a clue in many instances what you are talking about you do have a few valid points but they too may be predicated on false premise i do not claim to be the all knowing expert by using the same sensational bs tactics you rail against instead of a balanced and fair assessment you render the entirety of your rant incredible in short the wine has to go from point a to b in some way do you work for fedex it sounds like you would prefer you government welfare to go there instead wholesalers compete against each other perhaps you forgot they do not operate monopolies in oregon for instance there are about 60 wholesalers competing for partnerships on both the supply and the demand side hardly the ideal monopoly situation in most cases where state laws allow shipping you can get a bottle of wine shipped from the winery of your choice a very important point to remember while large commercial wineries factory wine producers may have the ability to market their own wine smaller growers whom you seem to be so concerned about do not have the proper infrastructure to allow wine sales on line in many cases let alone having their own transportation infrastructure they are experts at farming and producing wine which is what they likely prefer to do in most cases july 27 2010 at 0908 pm alean said wine facts are really good httpwwwfactsaboutwineinfo arunrobgmailcom october 13 2010 at 1239 pm crystal ortizz said quite

 facebook fans you get what you pay for 24 mar 2010 by rick take a look at the facebook fan pages of some brands and what you see is not a pretty picture oh the numbers look good but when you dig a little deeper a different picture emerges walls filled with off topic conversations at best vile language and real antipathy for the brand at worst what happened wasnt having thousands of fans supposed to be a good thing well yes and no sure its great having several hundred thousands fans but how did you come to get those fans did you earn them through fantastic customer service fulfilling the brand promise providing value to the community in an authentic and passionate voice or did you run a facebook ad campaign and hit the broadcast airwaves with a promotion lets look at my old favorite tgi fridays if you can see this then you might need a flash player upgrade or you need to install flash player if its missing get flash player from adobe remember that ad pretty cool right in fact as i recall they got over 1 million facebook fans google tgi fridays fan woody and it looks pretty good but then something not so awesome happened all those fans wanted their free burgers and they wanted them now tgi fridays completely lost control of the page and eventually doled out a lot of free burgersnow from a short term perspective im sure they did ok on the deal people came in and ate their food but they could have accomplished that with coupons in the mail the newspaper or by an email list but they decided to go the social media route now lets take a look at what the fridays fanwoody facebookpage looks like today whoops its gone apparently woody and his 900000 fans went poof how come im guessing it had something to do with the venom and general anarchy the page had created by buying fans rather than growing them a tgi fridays facebook page does exist with roughly a third of the fans they used to have tgi fridays pretty much had to spray agent orange on their relationship with 600000 people its easy to pick on tgi fridays but they certainly arent the only guilty party i think plenty of brands have heard the siren call of facebook ads the ability to target your demo is really terrific but youre in danger of creating a relationship with fans that ultimately is built on a what have you done for me lately foundation first you essentially bought these fans you paid facebook for the right to target them then in the case of tgi fridays or other brands that offer free product or discount coupons you are essentially buying them again this sets up a pattern where the consumer now expects to be rewarded for being your fan with a tangible item that is free stuff thats not a bonus item its now a standard part of the agreement want me as a fan give me free stuff the point of social media isnt to distribute coupons and a real fan wants to engage with a brand for a whole host of reasons often free discounted product is the least of these reasons im not saying that special bonuses or surprise and delight offers arent ever a good thing i think when used properly they can be terrific what do i mean by used properly as a reward for people who have engaged with the brand in a meaningful way send us a picture of you wearing a brand tshirt and sure youve earned a free sandwich recruit some friends and im happy to give you all some coupons but when fans enter the relationship feeling they are entitled to free samples and youre in trouble kathy sharpe says april 18 2010 at 102 pm about time there was some acknowledgement of the true value of fans even if you have 3 million fans and they are all well behaved citizens what is the real marketing value 
 how soon is now lebron james makes his decision the arod route 8 jul 2010 by rick lebron james is an extremely talented basketball player hes also a very astute individual who understands how to use the media and various communication channels to his advantage hes also managed to surround himself with people who understand business but im starting to wonder if hes lost a bit of understanding of american culture lebron didnt play college basketball he went straight from high school to the pros and since joining the cleveland cavaliers hes won exactly zero nba champions hes a free agent now and tonight he made his decision about which team hes going to play for in a very public manner with a live announcement on espn earlier this week lebron jumped on twitter and quickly gained a massive following this morning he announced lebron james was of course a trending topic and that hashtag was burning as well but im starting to wonder if lebron isnt painting himself into a corner and has maybe misread how quickly sentiment can change sure shaquille oneal once said ive won at every level but college and pro but shaq was always a larger than life literally character who was outgoing and had a great relationship with fans thats one of the reasons shaqs been a huge hit on twitter lebron doesnt have that sort of relationship with fans i think an appropriate comparison might be alex rodriguez an incredibly talented player perhaps the best in the game who went a very long time without winning a ring by making his announcement in this public way lebron has only heaped more pressure on himself ask arod how the media can turn on you when you put yourself above your teammates above the game james now finds himself in the following position 1 winning a title is expected immediately wherever he goes 2 not winning a title will be seen as a massive disappointment 3 winning a title will result in some saying that he couldnt do it alone 4 hes put himself in a position where if he leaves cleveland every other city and cleveland will be rooting against him sounds just like alex rodriguez doesnt it im no longer the target demographic for most of the products lebron endorses but you know what matters to me winning championships not live prime time press conferences not selfaggrandizing twitter hashtags and not quitting on his teammates during the playoffs lets see what the future holds for lebron we know hell be rich but how will he be viewed by fans across the country perhaps lebron should have hired a chief culture officer along with his coterie of other advisors if i were to fulfill that role for him i would have told him to go low key with this decision and let it be led by his new team make sure its clear that the team comes first and that hes looking forward to beingpart of the teamthat the only thing that matters is winning a championship that thatwas the main factor update lebron chooses the miami heat and the similarities to arod continue with dwyane wade playing the role of derek jeter update 2 and so it begins one comment dan winkler says july 9 2010 at 129 am heatenfreude 
 wednesday 26 may 2010 the effect of not being on vacation in italy on a man with a tall stack of papers to grade as you probably noticed my wife is currently on vacation without me which is different than a vacation from me although given how frequently insufferable i am i could understand the appeal of suchin the le marche region of italy which is immediately south of tuscany and full of communists as evidence of how thoroughly corrupt the region is i present a picture courtesy of her of the cabin shell be staying in free of charge until july thats the view shell be writing her dissertation to the next two months the region is poor though not so much as i thought and poorly serviced by internet and wifi theres a router up the hill from her which sometimes provides wifi but only then into a loft too unbearably hot to occupy during the day so the only opportunity i have to talk to her via skype is that last hour in the late evening when the loft cools enough to be habitableprovided of course that the wifi strength that evening is strong enough to establish and maintain a connection which it frequently isnt but this post isnt about how melancholy i become when i havent heard from her by 3 pm which would be midnight over there because anyone who follows me on facebook already knows that and because this post concerns urbino not my daily descent into emo ive written about urbino before but because the wife is providing me with such dazzling photographs of the city i feel compelled to do so again as i noted in that post urbino is not a built city so much as an evolved one the de landa seems to have become an unwitting theme of late of course it was built but it was built vertically within the city walls meaning that new buildings were constructed atop existing ones like so the effect is the sort of architecture one only finds in dreams or representations of them like the one in the finale of the fourth season of buffy the vampire slayer wherein joss whedon took advantage of contiguous threewalled film sets to depict xander harris moving seamlessly from the upstairs bathroom at buffys house into the initiatives underground bunker then from the bathroominitiative across the hall into his parents basement and into an ice cream truck past the the comehither lesbians through the back of the ice cream truck by means of a passage that returns him to you guessed it his parents basement in which he exits the same door he originally entered it from buffys house only to end up in the halls of sunnydale high and shortly an apocalypse now parody the only difference between what whedon did and urbino is that you could travel through the side streets of urbino with a camera and accomplish such feats minus the coppola without needing to cut once because without leaving officially sanctioned lanes of transportation pedestrians can venture into and through outdoor kitchens university departments the central hallway of apartment buildings and so on this photograph of the dueling signs for the hotel raffaello the wife snapped the other day typifies the way the city feels you can enter the hotel either through the door with the green awning or the second story window of an adjacent building this isnt technically true but it accurately describes how it feels to those unaccustomed to the citys geography the city is even more disturbing though because of the tendency of its sidewalks to transform into recessed brick ladders when the street becomes too steep for bipeds that picture is not from the current set as the relative quality attests and if i remember correctlyby which i mean recognize the fingerprints of amateur photographers the world over who think a good photograph is one framed in the most dull and predictable way possiblesnapped by me i only mention that because in 2002 i visited the city with the wife and as you probably guessed the real point of this post was to indulge in a bit of vicarious vacationing before returning to a stack of ungraded papers that no amount of actual grading seems to have the power to reduce if it wasnt even homer nods no but seriously if thats not a picture i actually took its exactly the sort i relentlessly take whereas check out the wifes chops above the woman has an eye if she is working she is not on vacation and this time apart will make you stronger and make you realize marriage is work and you need to put some in or the marriage dies and you are left with an empty hole in your heart i know this is over kill but you need to get out of the funk you are in and grade the papers and finish the course so you can get some down time and catch up on your sleep posted by alkau wednesday 26 may 2010 at 1111 am have a happy vacation that place looks fascinating i should get a passport posted by happyfeet wednesday 26 may 2010 at 0957 pm happy i dont normally like to contradict you but in this case i must im not the one on vacation sadly im having to live it

 this is the first in a series of articles by guest blogger the apocalyptic housewife somewhere in california a blighted mosquitovector abandoned property is about to get an echinacea dose via seedbomb seedbombing combines elements of childhood disgruntled mudbombhurling the balance of meticulousness and zen that good gardeners possess and my own forte the invisibility and vigilance of a sniper it also requires a certain attitude the first step to seedbombing is 1 understand that a job worth doing is worth doing crappily you will fuck it up live with this embrace it nothing worth doing was learned perfectly the first time if mother nature herself were perfect she wouldnt need us urban urchins to help cover her scars with flowering seeds heres where we started gift seeds of california poppy via jessica reeders mom thanks mamahun 2 mix in seeds use seeds of any kind even dumpstersalvaged ones or the ones that might be too old for the garden you can mix them with a 303040 mix of potting soil worm casings and clay or you could go out to the shed and grab a few handfuls of that sod mix you got at that estate sale last year and get to mixing note cover your work area dust can fly into your mouth and eyes very easily if the fertilizer in the mix is what i think it is that wouldnt be pretty use gloves to break up the soil with your fingers 3 make bombs form the mix into balls of any size from slingshotpellet up to softball youre going to be throwing them customize it yourself mine were more or less matzohball size and shape out of habit this worked out pretty well allow to dry overnight or until theyre solid enough for the next step 4 throw today i kept it simple i chose one abandoned property a few minutes from downtown and two vacant lots the leftovers went onto the jungles alongside the freeway offramps first lesson learned you need at least two people to seedbomb from a vehicle the first responsibility should be driving safely i found this hard to do while also avoiding cops dealing with the camera and the car window scoping out angles of approach for throwing etc i ended up with a broken fingernail and dirt all over my lap also a perfect strike but youll have to take my word because a camera at that moment would have been crazy second lesson keep the seedbombs in a shallow covered container you want both tidiness and easy access plus those things are crumbly i made eight the last two were totally pulverized after being jostled in a paper bag for half an hour and the last lesson have fun its play seedbombing is a hitormiss way for change to take root pun intended its chlorophyll graffiti no one i know is getting diggd or favrd yet for throwing color and scent around the ghetto do it to see how it feels you may want to keep checking on your flowers i promise i will or you might get an idea to do something else completely unexpected i did enzo angolini spike heels found by serendipity at st pauls thrift for 398 sexy non for example make smaller wildflower seedbombs and carefully plant them in a meridian by making holes in the ground with your heel and then gently tamping the dirt over them with your sole this is also good practice for looking lost and cluelessly invisible more on that in future posts 5 enjoy earth is my friend like that old classmate who you keep forgetting to drop a note to on facebook when i took a victory lap and handwash break in the mall i was happy not in a smug superior way but in the knowledge that i had avenged myself against the whole sundayatthemall culture that i felt smothered by i did it by throwing flowers all along those places no one goes but where our planets future lives there is one overriding message to this quit being such a goddamned perfectionist yes yes i know you know of much better places to never throw those seedbombs you havent made you could get better soil if you put it on the shopping list you undoubtedly write much better and could have a real serious article with awesome nonblurry pictures taken by a person who actually can get the timer to work for a goddamn change the actions that you never do are absolutely perfectly effective in your imagination but my actions accomplished something today which brings us back to 1 a job worth doing is worth doing crappily this blog is the digital proof 6 responses to the apocalyptic housewife goes seedbombing kate 25 nov 2009 at 337 pm did this with my aunt in griffith park after the last bout of fires didnt know there was a term for it my mom and aunt have been seed bombing for years theyll be glad to know it is catching on among the under60 set raggedy anarchy 25 nov 2009 at 546 pm thanks for commenting kate your mom and aunt sound great i used to see this old scary dude walking around checking the trees in griffith park for dutch elm disease turns out he had been a brilliant biology student before losing derferment and going to vietnam thanks for making me remember him we are everywhere summer 26 nov 2009 at 1052 am loved this brian 14 dec 2009 at 810 pm didnt know there was a name for this awesome idea though my wife and i did this when we lived in texas planted blue bonnets in a state park yeah i know texas has plenty of blue bonnets you say well we thought they could use more jessica reeder 15 dec 2009 at 908 am hey brian thanks for stopping by that was nice of you there is no such thing as too many flowers well done we just made seedbombs for our holiday gift baskets theyre a mix of flowers from the yard heavy on the poppies i am not nice young hip white rich educated suburban or any of the other things you are unconsciously assuming anyone who loves the earth must be my discontent is the mother of invention and by invention i mean creative repurposing i love bringing apt quotations and poems to awkward occasions the way another guest would bring a box of sees actually i do that too anyone who doesnt have a sweet tooth is bound to have a

less about consuming and more about redemption every day it makes me a little nicer 
 noshin at the tupelo honey cafe plus how to get great service in busy restaurants 23 mar 2010 by the time i got to asheville i was nearing the end of my journey and the bottom of my wallet the last thing on my mind was spending money it was beautiful outside and there were free things to do everywhere but when id posted on facebook that i was coming to town no fewer than three people told me i just had to visit the tupelo honey cafe so i checked their website and instantly fell in love tupelo honey caf opened in downtown asheville in 2000 an early pioneer in the farm to fork movement and an active advocate for the independent restaurant landscape that pervades the city our food is fresh made from scratch sassy and scrumptious our cuisine salutes our love of southern traditions at the table but like the good people of asheville marches to its own drum the result is a unique riff on southern favorites tupelohoneycafecom i was convinced but i wasnt alone on a sunny sunday afternoon the waiting list was an hour long after hemming and hawing and assessing my food stash contents 10 saltines i decided to go for it anyway by the time i finally got a seat at the counter i was starved it took me about thirty seconds to pick out the charleston chicken sandwich grilled marinated freerange chicken breast on sourdough with melted havarti romaine lettuce and cranberry mayonnaise free range cranberry havarti yes i could dig it while i waited for the food i checked out the back of the store where tupelo honey cafe hawks their homestyle wares preserves pickles salsa honey tshirts aprons and all sorts of miniadvertisements for the restaurant ive visited plenty of farmtofork restaurants and this one may be the best ive seen at selfmarketing theres nothing wrong with it the food in those jars is probably delicious though i question whether the 10 tupelo honey had to come from florida or if its produced locally either way its nice to see a restaurant built on ethics that also happens to be incredibly busy some of that is surely due to good marketing but the real reason for its popularity is this that sandwich was so good i found myself eating slower and slower with each bite to savor it more completely the potatoes were light and ungreasy the flavors were perfectly balanced the chicken was juicy and rich and lets be honest here im always happier eating dead animals when i know theyve lived a good life i found myself silently thanking the chicken for its delicious contribution thank you chicken i will never forget you i stopped eating halfway through not because i was full i stopped so i could take the rest home and taste it again later on another topic i made a discovery there in the tupelo honey cafe one which id like to share with you now if youre going to a busy restaurant and want great service bring a camera take a few photos of the menu the kitchen the food no sooner had i taken the above photo when a server not even my server appeared at my elbow later when i stopped eating and lifted my napkin from my lap it took approximately three seconds for someone to take my food away to be boxed up now im not saying the service before my cameraflash was bad because it was awesome but wow it sure improved once i appeared to be some sort of food critic or travel writer which it just so happens i am but even if youre not try this out sometime i cant guarantee itll work but i personally will do it againand probably back it up with a stellar review just like the one ive given the tupelo honey cafe everybody wins okay thats it i could talk about asheville for weeks but its time to move on next stop sunny tennessee where i get down on the farm 
 save the world ride a bike a visit to troy bike rescue 30 sep 2009 this post is the first of a threepart series on bike culture come back friday to read about anarchy bike jousting and twowheeled social protest remember when you got your first bike was it a christmas present or maybe a birthday gift remember how much fun you used to have on that bike how fast you went how great it felt well these days most kids want an xbox for their birthday their parents ride around in cars with seatbelts talking on their phones cycling is a thing of the past a sport a hobby but rarely a mode of transportation but im here to tell you riding your bike is still fun and still fast and its the cheapest and most socially responsible workout youll ever get and there are no two ways about it if you give a kid a bike that kid will ride in troy new york i met one andrew lynn hes somewhat of a man brain trust and one of his best creations is the troy bike rescue it started in 2001 when andrew would ride around town pulling bikes out of dumpsters he started hosting work parties with friends in his backyard teaching them to fix their bikes and helping them get started riding slowly but surely the circle grew and andrews backyard parties became weekly workshops when andrew decided to leave town for a few years schooling in nyc friends and cohorts took over operations by the time andrew returned troy bike rescue lets call it tbr had a life of its own these days its an established club run by volunteers and donations turning trashed bikes into treasures its influence now includes a legitimate downtown storefront a sister shop in albany albany bicycle coalition movie screenings and procycling political events and a dedicated core crew that keeps everything rolling tbrs customers run the gamut from businessmen to street kids to college students to families the one thing they have in common they get it this group understands the value of a bicycle more than just transportation a bike is a statement against fossil fuels more than a toy its an equalizer that allows poor kids to ride with rich more than a hobby its a way of traveling through the world that lets you interact use your muscles breathe fresh air all for the cost of a free dumpster bike when i visited the tbr shop it was packed with frames wheels gears chains handlebars kids and anarchist art the space is being donated by some supporters who are also anticapitalist activists tbr hosts workshops twice a week for a few hours the doors are open to anyone who walks in tools are available and volunteers will help with advice and knowledge parts can be had for a pittance and you can pick out your own bike from the stacks and racks of machines filling the space the main focus of tbr however is not selling bikes the idea is to give people a workspace and teach them how to maintain their own bicycle selfsufficiency is a major tenet of the bike movement and troy bike rescue is training selfreliant individuals of all stripes all around me college students and bike punks tinkered with their machines an older man asked for tips on tuning his racer a young kid came in to say his last bike was stolen and he needed a new one and despite andrews stern reprimand that he couldnt just walk in every week and leave with a free bike he did just that a dad came in with his three kids all of whom left with snazzy rides but first they all sat down and worked on their new wheels together and as we left at the end of the workshop a woman walked up to andrew i love what you do she said i have a whole bunch of bikes to give you see ultimately tbr is about more than just bicycles its about building community and triggering a quiet but inexorable social movement this is not the worlds first bike collective in fact its only one of many that have stealthily sprung up around america these collectives are not waiting for change to happen theyre creating it through small positive peaceful actions you too can change the world all you have to do is ride a bike try this at home ride around fall is here which in most places means great riding weather what are you waiting for bikes are cheap you can get one at your local thrift store for 550 it doesnt have to be perfect just good enough to get you places so pick one up and ride it to the end of your block then keep going even if your life requires four wheels you can use a bike for local errands ride it to the corner store when you need milk instead of driving across town to the grocery store dont like the milk they sell tell the store owner what you like and see if hell carry it now youre changing the world on weekends instead of driving to the park hop on your bike and go exploring it doesnt have to be a workout you can just toodle around town and look at stuff or if youre a gym buff trade a workout for a bike ride unless you live on a major highway odds are you can ride straight from your front porch to someplace interesting on vacation rent a bike instead of a scooter or god forbid a segway its cheaper and much better for the local florafauna still not convinced then think of it this way by riding your bike instead of driving your car youre reducing your consumption of fossil fuels you can even calculate the money you save on gas and keep it in a jar for a rainy day want to get involved bike clubs tend to be pretty anarchic but if you look around your community youll find both bike riders and shop owners who ride for change cant find a bike community start your own 5 responses to save the world ride a bike karen

 farming on sand the trouble with eating local on cape cod uprooted an ecotravel blog this is part 4 of a 4part series on tourisms impact on cape cod read about death carnage in the shell shop find out about the ecofriendly food scene look at the pretty pretty sunset or continue on david dewitt doesnt look like a farmer with his long hair scruffy beard and tshirt hed fit in more at a phish show than behind a plow but appearances are deceiving and davids comfy mien belies a passion that is influencing the culture of northern cape cod to wit in 2009 david helped launch the truro ag fair an event that exceeded all expectations and brought huge crowds to local farmers booths he runs the rock spray nursery a certified natural provider of evergreens and ornamentals and he manages the first light organic farm a lush green spot in a hollow of north truro here david and his partner arthur teubner work yearround growing heirloom and hardy fruits and veggies to sell at market davids a dedicated and inspired agrarian whose passion for farming keeps him optimistic but farming on the outer cape is the sort of sisyphian challenge that can wear anybody out the hard truth the soil of north truro is not strong enough to support agriculture without fertilization it deteriorates shockingly fast david points out a patch of sand with a thin strip of fertile loam along the edge last season it was a fertile veggie bed but it was left unfertilized as an experiment this is what happens david says you have to keep feeding it organic material or it turns back into sand this plot was a test run left untended for a single season last years rich loam is now useless sand its always been this way in north truro the outer cape is really just a spit of sand but still farmers lived here for generations how salt marsh hay there used to be a local tradition in this area at each spring tide the local community would head out to the bogs and marshes to harvest the grasses this was called salt marsh haying salt marsh hay has no weed seeds and it doesnt compact as heavily as other types of hay this makes it an excellent and bountiful source of compost and it was used for generations as a soil enricher but haying had to happen regularly says david theres so much oxygen in this soil any added compost gets burned up in six weeks all the nutrients get depleted that means soil left for two months without fresh compost will become you guessed it sand the only way to keep things going here is to keep a steady flow of compost coming in that means truckloads of hay and that means a lot of work last year david and arthur brought in a semi truck loaded with leaf mulch it worked but it cost money and it disappeared fast into the hungry ground not a longterm plan in bygone times the whole town of north truro would pitch in on haying days now davids on his own without that community support its nearly impossible for him to harvest hay often enough to keep the farm green meanwhile in tourist town usa the provincetown farmers market has lovely produce but little of it was grown on the cape provincetowns official population of 3500 supports a tourism industry that serves millions of visitors each year city folk marvel at the quaint charms of the cape its idyllic beauty and simple pleasures and then they go out to eat even if tourists were interested in sustainable food they totally dont care theyd be hard pressed to find a locallysourced meal raina stefani serves davids produce at her restaurant terra luna but it only makes up a portion of her fares the rest has to be shipped from the mainland you cant squeeze blood from a stone and you cant get big vegetable crops from sand dunes end of story well not exactly david isnt giving up in fact hes got plans and ideas to refashion north truros farming community hence the ag fair and the ongoing experimentation with varieties and soils at first light david isnt alone hes got the support and companionship of a growing group of gamechangers if the young farmers and foodies of truro can organize they might just be able to get local agriculture back on its feet their main opponent the tourism and real estate industries which insist upon turning every arable inch of the cape into somebodys backyard the same population that would consume the food produced here is actively inhibiting its production no surprise there after all whats the point of farming on the beach 2 responses to farming on sand melody m thibodeau 25 sep 2010 at 752 am if someone could start bedding the outer capes horses with this haystraw you know they could it would be even better for the system this would also make it more profitable the horses would be heathier they wouldnt have to be standing on the acidic sand all of the time the strawhay could also be a form of supplemental food for livestockhorses which has been used in before times the straw should be separated from the manure and dried in the air then buised by hooves then it is more ready to be mixed with the soil in the spring 
 jet lag pathophysiology and cures the longest monday of my life i recently returned to the us from australia the 14hour flight took me from monday morning in sydney to monday morning again in la crossing the date line messed up my sense of time enough without the added bonus of thinking i should be heading to bed just as the sun began to climb into the california sky you may be familiar with the concept jet lag the catchall name for circadian misalignment the disruption of sleep cycles and circadian rhythms if youve had the pleasure of crossing time zones in a jet plane whether it was a mere threehour hop from one coast of the us to the other or a trip to another continent chances are youve experienced some amount of jet lag the pathophysiology of jet lag normally two systemsthe homeostatic system and the circadian systemwork together to produce a 24hour sleep cycle during the day the homeostatic system slowly accumulates a sleep drive a desire to sleep that increases as a function of time spent awake the circadian system generates an alerting signal in opposition to this sleep drive which during the day keeps a person from feeling increasingly sleepy an hour or two before bedtime this signal subsides and she realizes its time to hit the pillow the sleep drive dissipates as a person sleeps and by morning assuming a full nights rest and possibly some coffee she will be feeling alert and ready to go again robert sack wrote a delightful paper pdf on jet lag by the way which is where im getting much of my information so weve got a nice cycle of sleep jet lag is what happens when the homeostatic and circadian processes are misaligned for example the circadian system may signal a person to be alert when its not actually morning or may be reduced during daytime hours causing daytime sleepiness because the homeostatic sleep drive is no longer cancelled out but i dont want to be sleepy how do you beat jet lag robert sack lists three primary approaches reset the body clock prescribed sleep scheduling medication to counteract daytime sleepiness or insomnia lets start with the first one as it turns out to be the most complicated resetting the body clock the two most effective ways to reset the body clock are 1 through bright light exposure and 2 timed melatonin administration light is one of the most important cues about time of day and has the greatest effect on circadian timing much smaller effects are seen from regular activities and meals for example studies have shown that without light cues totally blind people tend to have freerunning circadian rhythms with an average period of 245 hours instead of the usual 24 if a person is exposed to bright light early in the day the persons internal clock is reset to an earlier time if exposure is instead in the evening the internal clock is reset to a later time brighter light has more of an effect such as the sun at 3000 to 10000 lux though lower intensities eg 100550 lux can produce changes artificial light sources can be used to supplement daylight to help reset a persons internal clock to the correct new time zone when traveling alternatively a person could wear very dark glasses as light avoidance could help minimize the problems of light exposure at the wrong time of day or night resetting the body clock part 2 melatonin melatonin is a hormone that has been linked to the regulation of circadian rhythms and sleep cycles pdf melatonin is secreted by the pineal gland at night secretion is suppressed by light exposure and as such the hormone can be thought of as a darkness signal if doses of melatonin are administered in the morning circadian rhythms will be shifted later evening doses shift rhythms earlier timing of the doses is more important than amount per dose though it remains to be seen what the optimal dose and optimal time of administration istrials have been done with doses from 05 to 10mg at times ranging from three days before departure to five days after arrival in the new time zone if doses of melatonin are combined with light exposure the results are what you might expect synergistic if both are administered to produce a time shift in the same direction both earlier or both later antagonistic otherwise sleep wake sleep wake the second way to beat jet lag sleep at weird times slowly adjust your sleep schedule to match that of your destination or keep your home sleep schedule for a while after you arrive the problem with this is that your sleepwake schedule wont match up with that of the people around you and if you need to be awake for breakfast at 7am or for a meeting in the afternoon your sleep schedule may interfere use this method at your own risk drugs for everything lastly we have sleep medicines as you might guess hypnotic medications combat insomnia and stimulants fight off daytime sleepiness pretty well because by definition thats what they do both benzodiazepine and nonbenzodiazepine drugs have been shown to be effective in the first case for the latter the most common solution is to consume more coffee pdf this works in the study linked subjects were treated with slowrelease caffeine or with melatonin prior to a long eastward flight the caffeine subjects were less sleepy than either melatonin or placebo granted caffeine subjects also took longer to fall asleep later and awoke more frequently but that may be a risk you have to take lagging behind light melatonin drugs strange sleep schedules of course the only solution that will always work is time the homeostatic and circadian processes need to realign and while the aforementioned ways of beating jet lag can fast track the process it still takes time update i was alerted by a friend of the existence further research of which i was unaware another way to reset your sleepwake cycle is to stop eating if you fast for about 12 to 16 hours your body clock will reset with whatever time you break your fast as morning the fuller lu saper paper pdf published in science discusses the mechanism though a more recent paper argues that the fuller et al results are inconclusive 
 tibetan buddhist retreat faded squares of fabric strung together in repeating bluewhiteredgreenyellow chains crisscross the branches of barelimbed trees the gentle wind makes them flutter orangegold light filters into the grassy meadow touching a row of canvas tents and the temple house beyond tsechen kunchab ling temple of allencompassing great compassion this is the seat of his holiness the sakya trizin in the united states a tibetan buddhist monastery established nine years ago i spent the past weekend there the field work office at my college arranges this retreat every semester everyone ive talked to who has previously attended says wonderful things about it this semester one of my friends told me she was going i should join her i like learning new things so i signed up a good decision i didnt return all chill and zen as one friend told me his roommate had but i certainly gained a few new ideas and approaches to mull over and dipped my hand into a previously unfamiliar piece of the world medicine for ones mind the first evening the twentysomething studentsmost from my college four from anothergathered in the shrine room sitting crosslegged on cushions as we listened to khenpo kalsang introduce tibetan buddhist philosophy he began by telling us do not take any of what i say on faith take it through analysis if there is some benefit in it for you religion he said is like a drugstore full of medicine you do not go to the drugstore and buy everything in ityou just buy what would be beneficial to you now you believe the other medicine may have just as much value but in other situations not this one we discussed the foundations the three turnings of the wheel of dharma the four noble truths karma defilements the six perfections when we talked about the giving and how one should try to give what one could to other sentient beings in the form of material items kind words protection and so on khenpo kalsang shared a story of the buddha and how the buddha had given his flesh so that a family of hungry tigers could eat so a fellow student asked giving ones life for another being is the ultimate gift khenpo kalsang he smiled and shook his head only if you feel no regret he said if you feel regret it destroys the merit until then preserve your own life and do not give away anything that would cause you regret this struck a chord selfpreservation above all else unless the right situation arises knowing and understanding later i talked to the resident nun ani kunga about psychology and cognitive science she had studied psychology for a while in grad school but now holds the view that psychologists are going about understanding the mind and understanding the knower and what knowing is the wrong way psychologists she said study the brain and the self externally ever since the 1920s their science has been about observation of behavior questionnaires recordings of electrical brain activity but the mind can only be known by you the person whose mind it is she said philosophy and epistemology were doing it right looking at experiences from the inside a big overlap exists between tibetan buddhism psychology and cognitive science all three examine the distinction between the self and others between the observer and the observed between knowing and the knower i agree with ani kunga to some extentonly so much can be known about the mind from external observation but this doesnt mean that there isnt merit to such studies nor that nothing of use can be learned in that way tibetan buddhist philosophy also approaches the mind and the self from the inside during a second philsophy session khenpo kalsang translated a sutra about a king who received advice from the buddha this sutra delved into some questions about the nature of the self whether the self is a delusion and how the clinging of self is a defilement i intend to discuss it in more depth later so stay tuned compassion training and prayer flags in the afternoon a group of us gathered outside for a meditation session with ani kunga sunshine melted lazily through the tree branches above a breeze animating the branches shadows so they danced between our cushions compassion and anger were the sessions topics the key message if theres something you can do why are you unhappy just do it if theres nothing you can do why are you unhappy ani kunga explained several offsession and one onsession technique for dealing with negative emotions anger hate irritation stress jealousy and so on all the methods built off the idea that you are in control anger is an emotion and you can change your emotions stay tuned for a more indepth post on the topic another of the days activities was making prayer flags as ani kunga explained prayers wishes hopes aspirationssomeone many people may share those with you hanging the prayer flag shares your prayer with everyone else in the world this may do no good at all but it mayif everyone hopes and wishes and dreams and aspires perhaps it will do good it may not but if no one shares their prayers it will certainly do no good so on the offchance that it will help why not never done this weekend reminded me that im not done learning if i stay still long enough if ive achieved a relatively constant level of happiness and satisfaction i forget that i can and should continue to seek out new ideas and approaches and incorporate beneficial ones into my life a person is never done and so ill continue to observe and discuss and study trying to pick the directions in which ill change and trying to make tomorrow better than today ever onward and ever upward 
 selfcontrol selfefficacy and new years resolutions unresolved im not one to make new years resolutions i mean sure i could take my pick of popular new years resolutions i could decide on the first day of the new year that this year ill start exercising more and eating better or that ill spend more time with my family and friends or that ill learn a new skill and if i chose to make resolutions id be far from alonea 2008 survey on dorthycom found that 66 of the 2000 adults polled had made resolutions at some point though only 17 managed to keep them making resolutions its about selfcontrol the question anirban mukhopadhyay of the hong kong university and gita venkatarmani johar of the graduate school of business at columbia university asked is this what determines how many goals a person will set and how successful a person will be at achieving those goals they performed a few studies in 2005 to look at the relationship between selfcontrol goal setting and goal achievement they suggested that what you believe about selfcontrol affects the goals you set and achieve pdf in the paper selfcontrol is used to mean a sense of willpower mukhopadhyay venkatarmani discuss various lay theories of selfcontrol noting that the amount of selfcontrol a person has can be seen as either an inherently limited or unlimited resource and that this resource can be seen either as malleable or as fixed the amount of selfcontrol a person has can change over time or not an important premise to note here is the idea that the probability of choosing a goal or making a resolution increases if a person thinks that goal can be attained so if you think youll be able to achieve a goal youre more likely to set it combine this with theories of selfcontrol and in general if you believe you have unlimited stores of selfcontrol youll set a larger number of goals if you believe selfcontrol is malleable but limited youll set fewer goals mukhopadhyay venkatarmani also discuss selfefficacy belief in ones capabilities the perceived ability to carry out a desired action they propose that people with high selfefficacypeople who believe that failure is the result of insufficient effort and thus exhibit increased commitment and persistencewill achieve more of their goals than people with low selfefficacy who tend to view failure as the result of deficient ability and thus may simply give up the studies in the first study 85 participants all college students each read one of four passages presenting lay theories of selfcontrol each passage contained two paragraphs the first discussed selfcontrol either as limited or as unlimited and the second discussed selfcontrol as either malleable or fixed the participants then answered questions about their belief in each of two theories presented followed by a second questionnaire to assess motivation in which they listed all their current goals the study was testing whether a belief in unlimited malleable selfcontrol would result in most resolutions and indeed this is what was found the experimenters had some concerns about participants natural beliefs in relation to the passages they read however so in study two the order of the two measures lay theories and motivationgoal listing was varied data from 130 new participants revealed that as hypothesized if the motivation goals questionnaire were assessed first then among the people who believed selfcontrol is malleable those who also believed selfcontrol to be unlimited vs limited set more goals when lay theories were assessed first this result reversed the people who believed that selfcontrol is fixed were unaffected by order the third study moved on to examine goal achievement adding a measure to look at selfefficacy the study had two sessions in november then february in the first session the 159 participants read passages about lay theories much like in study one but with longer passages to strengthen the manipulation listed the resolutions they were planning on making at new years rated how disappointed they would be if they failed to keep their resolutions and filled out individual difference measures which included a selfefficacy scale only 86 participants successfully returned for the second session during which they indicated how much success they had had at keeping their resolutions what does this mean for your resolutions the resolutions made by participants across all conditions were qualitatively similar take a look at any list of popular new years resolutions and youll see the majority of the goals as shown in the first two studies more goals were set by people who believe selfcontrol is unlimited and malleable than by any other peoplethat is if you expect more success you may increase the difficulty and number of tasks that you set for yourself selfefficacy did not have a significant effect on goalsetting as far as success goes only the interaction between lay theory and selfefficacy was significant if participants believed in limited selfcontrol and were low in selfefficacy they tended to give up more often failing to achieve their goals but if participants believed in unlimited selfcontrol selfefficacy had no effect participants achieved just as many goals regardless and people who set more resolutions were marginally more likely to succeed mukhopadhyay venkatarmani realize that their research does not directly look at the relationship between lay theories of selfcontrol and beliefs about ones own amount of selfcontrol and selfefficacy and propose this as an area for future study but in general lay theories about selfcontrol can determine how much success youll expect and thus how many goals youll set and selfefficacy beliefs can determine how much success youll actually have

 varsity athletics credit or no its a matter of balance vassars varsity athletes may soon receive academic credit for participating in their sports during the school year this proposal has been in the works for nearly two years and at long last folks are voting to approve it or to not approve it but the former seems more likely as a member of the student athlete advisory committee and as a longtime varsity athlete you might say i have particular stake in the proposal after all i could get half a unit a semester for up to four semestersa typical class is worth one unit and a typical physical education course of any level is worth half a unit with a maximum of two physical education units counting toward graduation requirements it seems justified students can receive credit for participating in other extracurricular facultysupervised activities such as the orchestra the choir and the repertory dance theatre so why not varsity athletics my friend over at carolyn blogs agrees from the above standpoint sure it seems fair to give credit to students if you get credit for introductory pe classes you should get credit for varsity athletics but our school newspaper presents other arguments in favor which carolyn thinks are highly unjustified on top of everything we must remember that varsity athletics present a considerable time commitment it is rare to find another activity on campusacademic or extracurricularthat includes a comparable daily rigor and frequent overnight obligation varsity athletes regularly travel throughout the northeastern to participate in meets games and tournaments often gone from campus for an entire weekend at a time and you know what although its certainly frustrating to travel to boston for an allday competition on the same weekend as a good friends birthday party a fascinatingsounding lecture a dance party and seventeen other campus events no one in their right mind would ever want to miss i agree with carolyn the reason i participate in my sport is because i enjoy it if i cared more about other activities id do those instead simply being a huge time commitment is not a valid reason for awarding credit carolyns supporting example that higher level courses with more difficult and plentiful homework are worth the same amount of credit as introductory 100level courses drives this point home and shes backed up by our schools system of awarding units instead of credit hours this systemwhich in its most basic form allots one unit of credit per semester course regardless of difficulty hours in class and subject mattermakes vassar relatively unique in its credit system according to registrar dan giannini the rationale behind such a system is to try to send the message that all courses are equal in worth and that one shouldnt try to distinguish between courses based on time spent in or out of class the reason time commitment is highlighted is because according to the authors of the article the faculty must consider what it can do to mitigate possible academic pressures on these students um no i dont think the faculty has any obligation whatsoever students choose to be varsity athletes of their own accord if they cant manage to balance their athletics and their coursework then perhaps they should reconsider participating in a varsity sport in the first place athletes shouldnt get special privileges simply because theyre athletes personally i like the fact that even though i dedicate huge chunks of time to my sport more time than i dedicate to any single course at least while inseason i can still keep up with my classmates who are taking comparable course loads minus the sport sacrifices must be made sure dance party on friday night or overnight travel to a competition the question is whats more important to me you learn stuff too the article continues while athletes will continue to be held to the colleges rigorous academic standards the athletics credit could discourage a varsity athlete from unnecessarily taking on five academic credits while in their athletic season with the proposed varsity credit the athlete seeking to assume five courses in his or her athletic season will be checked with an overload form thus encouraging the student to think twice about assuming such a large academic and extracurricular load id like to be known that students who have trouble balancing tough course loads and timeconsuming extracurriculars have always had the option of taking a lighter load or dropping an extracurricular adding the option of a varsity unit to the list doesnt make much of a difference students who arent varsity athletes could add an easy pe course instead students who can balance their work and their sport will continue to do so and let it be known varsity athletes dont have to take a half unit for their sport thus negating the need for an overload form if taking five courses carolyn says in response to the above quote that participating in sports is optional and should always take second place to academics true mostly academics are officially what college is about academics are what get graded students gpas will in part determine what they are able to do with their lives but academics are only one particular kind of knowledge carolyns statement assumes that a student can learn more important things from academics than from participation on a sports team personally though some of the most important things ive learned about persistence goalsetting success and excellence effort teamwork leadership these ive learned from my sport and my coaches its a different kind of knowledge than what one typically gains in an academic course yes but its no less important and that i think is the best reason for awarding credit for varsity athletics 
 detroit and the myth of the 100 house uprooted an ecotravel blog americas rust belt is a swath of cities and towns that boomed during the industrial era and now lie well rusting as empty remainders of glory days past chief among these is detroit motor city the longtime center of american automotive manufacturing was gutted when the big three car companies simultaneously failed detroit already plagued by corruption and crime saw its unemployment rate skyrocket in 2009 whats left behind when an economy collapses cheap real estate thats what id read a new york times article about some forwardthinking artisttypes who bought a house in detroit for 1900 1900 some of us and lots of new yorkers pay that much in rent every month in fact the article went on soon a nearby house went on the market for 100 the artist types notified their buddies who moved in post haste i was intrigued really a 100 house even if it was a real fixerupper even if you really were better off tearing it down than living in it thatd still be a hell of a deal why out in new mexico where you can still buy unincorporated land with no water or roads youd pay at least 1000 for a housesized plot of dust so how can you buy an actual home for 100 thats literally cheaper than dirt the possibilities of this were fascinating i had visions of hipsters from coast to coast converging in detroit building a new city on rockroll i pictured young artists owning homes fixing up neighborhoods i saw community gardens art parks a grassroots transformation of a city we could take that oilstained soil and those rusted factories and create something new and beautiful with houses going for 100 i thought what would you have to lose by moving to detroit and so quiet earp and i did some research and came up with a list of houses selling for under a grand we had plenty to choose from there were more cheap houses than we would have time to visit we picked two neighborhoods to cruise and dove in but once we entered detroit the truth hit fast this is a modern american ghost town the place is practically deserted its streets built wide to accommodate heavy traffic are mostly empty houses and businesses are boarded up painted up bombed out and falling down even in the center of the business district theres no traffic and hardly any people dont believe me i videotaped it it got worse as we drove into residential areas looking for those cheap houses in fact ive never felt so out of place in all my life even in chicagos south side where we counted five white people in an hour i felt fine just driving around not so in detroit truthfully it wasnt about race it was about being naive it was about driving down streets where we truly did not belong and were not welcome detroit is a ghost town and its inhabited by ghosts the only people left here are those who cant or wont leave they live in deserted neighborhoods in houses with collapsed front steps and missing windows they sit on the porch and watch the cars go by watch the deals go down watch their neighborhoods crumble and we driving through slowly and reading house numbers in a latemodel honda stuck out like a couple of thumbs so we sped up and went straight to the houses sometimes we stopped to take a photo but mostly we didnt earp and i have each lived happily in the wilds of west oakland but the danger i felt in detroit was like nothing id experienced before i was actually afraid for my life the new york times correspondent wrote that his friend mitchs 1900 home had already been stripped of its appliances and wiring but for mitch that only added to its appeal because he now had the opportunity to renovate it with solar heating solar electricity and lowcost highefficiency appliances as for the 100 house it needed some work a hole patched some windows replaced well i dont know what part of detroit these folks live in but the 100 houses i saw looked more like this you see abandoned houses in this town get set on fire no exceptions wherever we went in those neighborhoods one in four houses had been torched on one corner we saw a giant banner hung across a charred front porch we didnt slow down to take a photo but ill paraphrase dont burn houses down detroit police are watching you except that they obviously arent people who live in this part of town are on their own and although i and many others would love to own even a firescarred condemned building the fact is that we wouldnt last a week here buy a 100 house in detroit and you get a lifetime supply of sleepless nights youll spend the next several years waiting for burglars and arsonists murderers and crackheads to break in the windows its like the wild west without the scenery the gold and the hope its the rust belt ultimately i do believe that change will come to detroit there will be a green movement here in fact its already being cultivated by forwardthinking groups and intrepid locals one day this place will be reborn but right now the nyts story reeks of shinola truth is any artisttype who moves into this part of detroit is probably pretty handy with a pistol or a shotgun anyone who takes this plunge is risking their life every day betting on a future that may take a long time to arrive long story short yes you can buy a house in detroit for 100 and you will get what you pay for cheers to toby barlow who inspired my trek to detroit and who believes in a happier greener future may your every dream come true sir and your book sell fabulously 16 responses to detroit and the myth of the 100 house bisnis 16 sep 2009 at 946 pm great post thank you for this info i need that myself 19 sep 2009 at 1006 am please track down and watch a movie called detroit a city to yourself by nicole macdonald its full of this imagery and talks about the 1805 fire and rebuilding and the postindustrial devastation thats ravaged the city since most poignantly it talks about hurricane katrina which focused attention on rebuilding another city with this level of devastation and how without a single catastrophic event to blame for it detroits decay has gone unsympathetically ignored the movie wraps up by observing this how abandoned buildings and spaces are being reclaimed by nature about the pop fiction which explores the concept of a posthuman world and how it already exists now and about how if youre a pheasant thats not such a bad thing however theres a lot more to detroit than that there are industrial spaces being turned into lowrent artist lofts and business incubators look at the russell industrial complex for one example there are neighborhoods that refuse to cave west of livernois around mcnichols theres a whole bunch of nice stuff happening along the riverfront from downtown up towards stroh place and theres always belle isle when friends come to detroit i take them there its our intheriver park 982 acres of green space with a zoo a botanical garden and conservatory rentable paddle boats and tons of other neat stuff next time youre in detroit please head over oh and entry is free so its available to anyone regardless of economic status youre liable to see families picnicking bums gathering bottles and cans geese foraging and deer cautiously wandering the edge of the woods within a hundred yards of each other some of that cheap real estate isnt too horrible either theres a whole street being taken over by artists farnsworth between moran and mcdougall some of the things theyve done down there are amazing and the community garden is a great bridge to the surrounding neighborhood a few weeks ago someone broke into their shed to steal their garden tools think about that for a moment hoes and shovels dont have enough pawn value to be worth carrying out whoever took that stuff is probably using it in their own garden yes detroits got more than its share of bad spots youre right ive lived in the metro area my whole life and there are areas i cant call them neighborhoods down there where i dont feel safe in daytime much less at night but there are bright spots and behind every one of them is a person or a bunch of people who refuse to give up jessica 19 sep 2009 at 1030 am myself thanks for the comment and the great information you are exactly the kind of person who gives me back the hope i lost on my way into town seems theres a pretty solid group of detroit residents who are truly committed to restoring the city and thats beautiful to see love the fact that people are stealing garden implements though its still sad that they need to i will absolutely watch a city to yourself thank you for the recommendation and when im in the area again ill go out to belle isle and think longhard about the future of american citiesas im sure you do occasionally too reader not writer 20 sep 2009 at 1017 pm well growing up not far from detroit myself i would point out a few things 1 driving a honda in detroit right now probably isnt really going to get you welcomed with open arms see theres a wee bit of loyalty to the big 3 and driving a foreign car doesnt really scream solidarity to those struggling to survive most of the funny looks you got were less about your color than about your ride you think im kidding but i couldnt be more serious that honda is a visceral reminder for people of how the american consumer has left detroit in the dust 2 detroit proper has been dying for a long time before the 1968 riots even its going to take some pioneering individuals to start creating those pockets of innovation creativity and vision but its not going to happen with the investment of 100 into a single house someone will need to begin by creating an urban oasis that mitigates some of the fears that you had while driving through the city where to buy groceries a place where you can feel safe on your own front porch the freedom to sleep soundly without worrying about your copper wiring 3 for all that is wrong with detroit and thats nearly everything youd be astonished by the pride that detroiters have for their city they lack the means to build her back to her former glory but she wont be abandoned for all of those who are trapped there by their circumstances there are just as many who insist that they wouldnt live anywhere else raggedy anarchy 21 sep 2009 at 721 pm thank you for the opportunity to see postbushco era detroit through the prism of your vision ive never been there but ever since that mad possessed american history professor i had ive been haunted by detroit no even before that the dollmaker has often been called americas least pretentious masterpiece joyce carol oates in the nytbr when folks like gertie nevels and levon helm and john hiatt and my favorite john henry left the mountains to go wrestle with the industrial leviathan in detroit they were in it to the death detroit wont be the death of the courage of those early detroit pioneers it looks like nature will prevail after all everybody wins i love what you are doing uncle b 18 oct 2009 at 753 am is this the monument left behind for the world to witness by corporatism capitalism is this the greatness they built on earth is this the proof that all countries deserve democracy and its inevitable cancers corporatism and capitalism we die in war to bring this to other countries this american glory in a classless society this is the final phase the crowning glory of americas greatness does this show our systems superiority over the commies in china the old soviet guard europes follies have we really built a great society or is that all propaganda bull shiite to hush free thought eyes to the flag while our pockets and resources were raided by shysters spinmeisters schmucks and banksters did we build sane sustainable survival shelter homes do we still have fertile backyard gardens filled with the composting of the age can any of what we built be recovered restored renovated into useful shelter did the tools of production really get sold to the shareholders benefit leaving the worker without means to defend himself have the great fortunes earned in trust as american for american investment here in america really migrated to the beijing shanghai and hangseng markets converted to safer yuan and invested in chinas wealth did this really happen to american patriots do you still love democracy corporatism capitalism and all it has done for you are you really free is conscription just around the corner to serve halliburtondubai in attaining pipeline clearance through afghanistan to turkmenistan and the oil field there are american lives well spent in thei middle east endevor are we just mercenaries for big oil not liberators spreading freedom is this really just flagwaving propaganda what exactly did we win in iraq cheaper oil i think not gratitude of a free nation i think not why has the rust belt come into being what were we doing where did the great society for all the one we were told we were building go japan china to the uberrich as we sink into our own ruins the dark horse rides on america the dark horse rides on sad lumpy 22 oct 2009 at 314 pm green movement you gotta be kidding me earth to jessica democrats caused this they have the unmidas touch every decaying city in america has ds firmly in control and has forever when you said you were naive you werent kidding jessica reeder 22 oct 2009 at 336 pm nope i wasnt kidding put it in writing didnt i lumpy im not a democrat and i dont much approve of the democratic party just so were clear on that i dont think you present a fullyinformed argument on the causes of urban decay but i dont disagree with you im not particularly interested in whose fault this mess is rather i choose to focus on how were going to clean it up thats where the green movement comes in and when i say green im talking plants not politics if youve got some fancy new technology at boeing that can do more for peoples health and happiness and for less cost than a victory garden can do please let me know raggedy anarchy 24 oct 2009 at 617 pm last i checked greed sloth hubris and waste were all pretty universally human traits and i see no halos around either libertarians dems or even anarchically greenatheart i agree democrats like country music have disappointed me too many times in the past for me to keep on listening but heres the thing frogs are mutating due to the planet trying to kill itself salmon have forgot how to screw otters in postvaldez alaska are clawing their own petrochemicalburned eyes out in pain the patient is earth and its not getting better you want to yell at which insurance company fucked up or change a bedpan so to speak during times of crisis which this is the ones who will create positive change are those who accept the hand they are dealt and act the ones who are educated and informed and attached to delegating moral judgements will be perfectly equipped to deal with a world that no longer exists just ask the palestinians who left after the first war to cry over the past or ask my paiute grandfather or even friend salmon who still haunts my dreams and tells me not to let us blow each others asses off the earth until we clean up the mess we have made that was for lumpy nobody gets laughed at alone in my presence raggedy anarchy 24 oct 2009 at 621 pm when i say green im talking plants not politics walle eric 01 nov 2009 at 1033 pm there is now a house for 10 listed on realtorcom helena 19 nov 2009 at 106 pm you told me about this but it has to be seen to be believed not that i didnt believe you the richest country in the world fred e 18 jan 2010 at 809 pm dont forget about the back taxes parker 15 may 2010 at 656 am i find this topic fascinating i was born in a suburb of detroit and most of family still lives there i will be going back to visit in june i plan to take a daytime tour of these decaying areas especially the old factories i have the urban explorer fascination however the main reason i wanted to post was to say to lumpy the democrats have the unmidas touch lmao that is classic and i must agree with lumpy freaking hillarious and so true thanks lumpman btw great blog and great info peace brad 14 oct 2010 at 702 pm i too checked out a few listings for under 1000 and was absolutely shocked at the property taxes a 1000 house which could be fixed up into maybe a 3040000 house comes with a tax bill of 46k per year the taxes on my 140k house in an urban area of mississippi are only 1500year additionally even if you paid cash for the house youd probably want to carry some homeowners insurance with all the inherent risks to the property arson vandalism and im sure its skyhigh given those risks 
 united carbon offset disappointment april 27 2009 908 am im a big believer in carbon offsets not so much the cap and trade game but in the simple internalizeyourexternalitysort i talk about it in my green culture talk imho we all have an ethical obligation to offset our carbon footprint now my wife and i have been doing so for a couple years were a couple months late buying credits for last year one reason were late other than the obvious is the insane complexity in calculating it well i travel way too much thats the biggest chunk to cover but to calculate it accurately requires churning through a pile of flights i could estimate no doubt but i want something more accurate so i was really happy to see on the united page an announcement of a carbon offset program what i expected it to be was a simple way to at least know what the total carbon footprint from your flights for some period was after all they have all the data and ideally a simple way to buy offsets no such luck united has simple linked to one of the million places where you can calculate a per flight carbon cost it allows you to input total miles flown but its mileage plus page doesnt give you total miles flown it gives you the total added to your account included bonuses etc looking forward to version 20 posted by lawrence lessig on april 27 2009 908 am comments 14 april 27 2009 942 am peter collopy dopplr has a nice carbon calculator builtin you have to enter all your trips but i think its generally an exciting system if you dont mind the little brother surveillance april 27 2009 949 am lessig great point i do enter all mine in perfect solution april 27 2009 953 am padraic why arent you a supporter of cap trade isnt a mandatory scheme going to moresuccesful than voluntary measures april 27 2009 1020 am lessig i favor a mandatory scheme internalize your externality i am suspicious of cap trade it seems like a complicated partial version of that created by the same genius quants who gave us the mess on wall street that is designed to generate large fees finance types my sense is for a simpler system april 27 2009 1207 pm padraic ryan re cap trade you shouldnt use the financial crisis as an excuse to write off all of economics a cap trade system worked very well at reducing sulfur dioxide pollution in the us finance types and all youre right that a carbon tax is definitely simpler but there are upsides to cap trade as well such as the fact that the market will drive the price up whereas a tax wont increase unless congress wants it to re your green culture talk i think you are misappropriating the gore clip isnt he saying that your money would be better spent on political candidates and organizations that push for mandatory internalizing of externalities changing the laws instead of on carbon offsets changing the lightbulbs my problem with carbon offsets and other voluntary measures is that given the finite amount of money energy and attention we have to push for the environment i feel like the opportunity cost of these measures is too high compared to policyoriented actions the citizen role that gore referred for example earth hour would be much more productive if it were a global rally for carbon taxes instead we depoliticize it and entertain the idea that voluntarily turning off lights will stop climate change im a big fan of your work on ip and corruption but im skeptical of these initial ventures into the environmental arena april 27 2009 1217 pm mark i am suspicious of cap trade it seems like a complicated partial version of that created by the same genius quants who gave us the mess on wall street that is designed to generate large fees finance types my sense is for a simpler system that just shows you do not fully understand the cap and trade modelor the global financial crisis april 27 2009 251 pmcathy when you book a route on united it tells you how many miles it will accrue prebonus for each leg i use it to calculate how many ill get towards my premier status its a tiny link they move around from time to time but look for it near where the seat selection option is you should see this on a screen before you purchase the ticket and possibly also after april 27 2009 445 pm brad templeton when i got to uniteds site it has two columns one for true miles flown sort of and one for elite bonus so cut and paste into your spreadsheet and it should be fine however it does show 500 for the short haul flights but i bet those are mostly la so you can fill in the real mileage to la on those it should not take long april 27 2009 603 pmyaacov iland id check into the effectiveness of carbon offsets particularly tree plantations before spending money on them httpwwwnewintorgfeatures20060701keynote april 28 2009 903 am jardinero1 the only way to reduce your carbon footprint is to reduce your carbon footprint period paying someone else to do something they are doing already does not reduce your carbon footprint one bit if you dont believe that and still insist on paying someone else to consume less then please consider paying me my wife and i telecommute we rarely travel i ride my bike to the grocery store we cook from whole ingredients and never eat processed or prepared foods both of our cars are high mpg and rarely used they are both ten years old and we probably wont replace them for another ten years i just finished insulating my house and installed high efficiency windows and hvac i keep the thermostat high in the summer and low in the winter all the light bulbs are fluorescent except for the dimmer above the dining room table i removed all the turf from my property and replaced it with vines and perennials there are twenty three trees on the property sequestering co2 on a continuous basis no motorized equipment is required to maintain my garden which is now over ten thousand square feet of co2 consuming plants i would gladly accept the sum of fifteen thousand dollars from prof lessig or anyone else to offset his carbon heavy lifestyle in return i would submit to an audit of my lifestyle and i would issue him a certificate stating the amount of his carbon offset april 29 2009 400 am eric the red carbon credits indulgences for the noncatholic crowd more modern but just as dumb april 29 2009 718 am pb we all have an ethical obligation to offset our carbon footprint now there is nothing so dangerous as someone with an abundance of selfrighteousness but very little knowledge carbon offsets harm environment httpnewsbbccouk1hiukpolitics6378471stm tuesday 20 february 2007 1731 gmt jutta kill of the forests and the european union resource network fern was the most vehement opponent of the practice arguing it probably did more harm than good carbon offsetting was an unbelievably inefficient way of reducing emissions she argued and its effects were impossible to verify in addition more than half of the money given to companies selling carbon offsets went on research and administration costs benefiting not the climate but the burgeoning consultancy industry we believe it is worse than nothing because it creates the illusion or the impression in the public that action is being taken while we are not really addressing the task at hand significantly reducing greenhouse gas emissions ms kill told mps illusions are powerful around here it seems professor stop listening to your intuitions and do some basic research may 14 2009 245 pm jason sperling its nice to see feedback on the united program ive posted your feedback on my carbon offsets news blog currently many companies are reticent to putting something in their purchase path as an upsell just as they are reticent to putting anything in their purchase path the cost for large companies to make any updates to their ecommerce sites is significant another factor in keeping the type of program youd like from being available additionally there is a reluctance to share the data required for accurate emissions measurement due to perceived potential risks possibly related to future regulatory concerns the technology is certainly available when the type of program you imagine is put in place the results have been very good for example shopgreen merchant reports 90 of customers go green june 10 2009 1218 pm jason check out this great new idea to offset

 how soon is now blog archive zombies and vampires and ninjas and pirates 25 jul 2010 by rick its tough to kill the vampiregenre i was noodling on vampires the other day but also lumped zombies pirates and ninjas in the mix these archetypes seem different to me than other trends surely the vampire was dead after the spoof love at first bite in 1979 but then the anne rice led revival brought it back technically the 1st book interview with the vampire was published in 1976 but didnt gain widespread popularity until later then it jumped the shark with the tom cruisebrad pitt movie based on the anne rice novel in 1994 but bubbling below the surface was blade and other genre flicks then twilight hit and now vampires are hot surely ninjas were done with horrible movies like american ninja 1985 or with comedies starring chris farley beverly hills ninja 1997 and yet ninja has become a replacement word for expert to the point where its almost accepted parlance a twellow search for ninja turned up more than 7000 twitter accounts using the term in their profiles ninja warrior is one of the most popular shows on g4 we can put pirates away now after the 3rd pirates of the caribbean flick right no actually if weve learned anything its that genre memes just go back underground pirates for adults nsfwyou get the point0 these characters are like zombies pun intended they just keep coming back to life so its not just a matter of knowing when to jump off the vampire merrygoround its knowing when and where to jump back on if you jumped off vampires would you have known to jump back on in time to publish twilight fourteen literary agents rejected it before stephenie meyer got a deal if you were off zombies would you have gotten back on it time to publish ny times bestseller pride prejudice and zombies i dont think you can get off any of these you have to triangulate your decision across several nodes of popular culture a triangulation that has to revolve around the audience young adult twilght mature true blood and subgenre comedy horror scifi and then the actual quality of the content so what sort of matrix board do you have to create to know that a nc17 comedy horror zombie video game will work but a pg13 young adult timetravelling vampire tv show wont you cant all you can do is hope you bat 300 and that when you fail you fail fast ahh the classics if you broaden your scope a bit i think it would be difficult to find a time over the last 40 years or so when any of these four archetypes didnt have a level of bubbling popularity via books comic books tv movies video games music if all youre looking at is 1 or 2 content categories maybe it looks like theyre dead but they may be flourishing elsewhere and like a virus theyre just waiting for a new host to carry them to the mainstream publishers producers editors tv execs they all have to calibrate their decisions based on so many factors and yet even with access to sophisticated data it often comes down to human factors a gut instinct that something is going to work somebody at amc is greenlighting the walking dead based partly on historical evidence that says people like zombies but also partly on the notion that this particular iteration will have a new twist that will bring new people into the zombie and amc tent personally im waiting for someone to make pirate zombies v ninja vampires hey if they can make aliens and cowboys anything is possible this post was inspired by a recent post by grant mccracken make sure you read that one too 3 comments matthew duhan says july 26 2010 at 513 pm i dont know about pirate zombies v ninja vampires but there is a game where you can play to become zombies ninjas pirates and mad scientists zombie ninja pirates by gozer games is a quick 2030 minute card game for 26 players you can find more information on our website we do have an expansion planned which will add vampires among other types to the mix there will be more info about that coming soon jewell bardwell says july 30 2010 at 406 am incredibly effectively performed without a doubt estefana sjerven says september 16 2010 at 803 pm i like twilight i could sit and watch all day long if i didnt have schoolor life to stay me from doing it lol wonderful simply superb

my respect for you as a ceo a business leader and a person my wife is one of your employees who routinely shares stories about you that are nothing less than inspiring i know that during difficult times sometimes words emerge that can help people through difficult times i believe that you are sincere man and know that you must be broken hearted but i hope that this article can help you lead a dispirted workforce to see things more clearly my wife shelly pierce has worked for enron for the past two years and like many of your employees has lost a great deal of her life savings of course i accept most of the blame for this for reasons related to this article i lost my investment discipline and held out the false hope that enron could not falter after reading the article to her while i was out of town i believe that her spirit was a bit rejuvenated and she was ready to face the challenges that lay before you mr lay i appreciate the opportunity that you have given my wife and our family and hope that this story inspires you to regain your successes from the usa today tuesday november 27 2001 page 15a in recession face brutal facts thrive by jim collins a man in his early 20s recently asked me so whats a recession like its an entirely alien concept to him hed grown up during the greatest economic boom in modern memory his question drove home the fact that we havent faced a severe protracted economic setback for nearly 2 decades leaving us terribly unpracticed at dealing with tough times with this recession long in coming perhaps long to stay now officially upon us it is imperative that corporate leaders relearn a key lesson about how great companies and great people deal with difficult times differently from how they deal with merely good ones that lesson is the stockdale paradox a peculiar psychology shown by those who emerge from tough times not just intact but stronger adm jim stockdale was the highestranking us military officer in the hanoi prison camp during the vietnam war tortured many times during his 8year imprisonment stockdale lived without any prisoners rights no set release date and no certainty as to whether he would ever again see his family he shouldered the burden of command while fighting an internal war against his captors and their attempts to use the prisoners for propaganda at one point he beat himself with a stool and cut himself with a razor deliberately disfiguring himself so that he could not be put on video as an example of a welltreated prisoner he exchanged secret intelligence information with his wife through their letters knowing that discovery would mean more torture and perhaps death after his release stockdale became the first threestar officer in the history of the navy to wear both aviator wings and the congressional medal of honor you can understand then my anticipation at the prospect of spending part of an afternoon with stockdale who happened to be at the hoover institute across the street from my office when i taught at stanford in preparation i read in love and war the book he and his wife wrote to chronicle their experiences those 8 years as i read the book i found myself getting depressed it just seemed so bleak the uncertainty of his fate the brutality of his captors and then it dawned on me here i am sitting in my warm comfortable office looking out over the stanford campus on a beautiful saturday afternoon im getting depressed reading this and i know that he gets out reunites with his family and becomes a national hero if it feels depressing for me how on earth did he deal with it when he was actually there and did not know the end of the story i never lost faith in the end of the story stockdale said when i asked him i never doubted not only that i would get out but also that i would prevail in the end and turn the experience into the defining event of my life that in retrospect i would not trade i didnt say anything for many minutes and we continued the slow walk toward the faculty club stockdale limping and arcswinging his leg still stiff from repeated torture finally i asked who didnt make it out oh thats easy he said the optimists the optimists i dont understand i said completely confused the optimists oh they were the ones who said were going to be out by christmas and christmas would come and christmas would go then theyd say were going to be out by easter and easter would come and easter would go and then thanksgiving and then it would be christmas again and they died of a broken heart after another long pause he turned to me and said this is a very important lesson you must never confuse faith that you will prevail in the end which you can never afford to lose with the need for discipline to confront the most brutal facts of your current reality whatever they might be my conversation with stockdale had a profound influence on me but i never really considered it a business lesson until my research team began to wrestle with the question of why some companies rise from difficulty to become great while others emerge from those exact same difficulties weakened and dispirited we found that companies that became great embraced a corporate version of the stockdale paradox fannie mae for example found itself in the 1982 recession losing 1m every business day with 56b in loans under water many analysts thought fannie mae which was getting 9 on its mortgage portfolio but paying 15 on the debt it issued was doomed but ceo david maxwell and his team never wavered in their aim to not merely survive but also to prevail as a great company yes they confronted the brutal fact that the interestrate problem was not going to magically disappear certainly not by christmas but they used this grim fact as a catalyst for creating an entirely new business model based on asking three central questions of greatness what can we potentially do better than any other company in the world what can best drive our economic engine what best ignites the passions of our people instead of reacting to the recession with mindless restructuring fannie mae rebuilt itself based on its answers to these questions eventually it generated investor returns nearly eight times those of the general stock market when asked how he dealt with the nay sayers and the analysts who wrote fannie mae off maxwell said that it was never an issue inside the company of course we had to stop doing a lot of stupid things but we never entertained the possibility that we would fail we were going to use the calamity as an opportunity to remake fannie maw into a great company the sad truth is that most executive teams wont respond that way to these dark days of uncertainty instead of using this recession as an opportunity to fundamentally rethink their business and rebuild a culture of discipline the will simply restructure lay off a bunch of people and liquidate their cultural equity mediocre leaders will hold out false hopes for a quick fix only to watch those hopes be swept away by events their companies will begin to die of a broken heart it need not be this way those who lead with the stockdale paradox those who retain the unwavering faith that they will find a way to prevail in the end but who also retain the discipline to confront the most brutal facts of reality will find this an ideal time to rebuild and reinforce greatness used correctly this recession can be a defining time in your firms history that in retrospect you would not trade used wrongly this recession will weaken your foundations and make it that much harder to become great the choice is yours jim collins the author of good to great operates a managementresearch laboratory in boulder colo regards steve steve alexander vice president north

this morning with some backup info that ive included below attached is the email that was sent to ken lays office yesterday evening f or delivery to sen brulte its of course confidential few points i dont have bevs email so if you could please forward to her that would be appreciated as we discussed jim mike bev scott hedy on our lengthy call on wednesday im assuming that the plan is still to wallpaper sacramento wi th our proposed legislation this email does not contain the legislation mike sent the final version s of our legislation out yesterday except for the siting piece which i believe brian cragg of mikes office is finalizing today youll note that we promise senator brulte in the email that well deliver to his office today the proposed legislation again based on our call on wednesday im assuming that we would simultaneously release the proposed legislation to the rest of the world at the same time when we spoke on wednesday we decided that the sacramento team would determine to whom we would circulate the proposed legislation at the same time that we deliver the senator brulte im assuming that you folks will handle that end of things please let us know at your convenience to whom youve decided to circulate this email does however include a summary of our proposed legislation but im not certain that the summary included in this email is the appropriate language to distribute to the world or if well need instead to tailor some new language i think we all agreed that we need a one pager to accompany the legislative package so that we can communicate the package effectively we also discussed the need to quickly develop a coalition to support our proposals we didnt finalize that plan perhaps the sacramento team coul d propose a plan to do that perhaps we could start with our friends in the direct access coalition we also talked about the need at this point to engage in pr and to get the pr machinery activated also with the goal of effectively communicating our legislative packagemessage were in a meeting with folks today where we can discuss getting that side of things going and karen denne has contacted marathon and theyre pondering some things that we can do in the near term youll note that theres a considerable amount of information about the dwr credit issue as i recollect we discussed the issue in depth on the call you note that attached to the email is a legislative fix to ab1x that cou ld solve the credit issue and an attached set of taking points related to a second alternative to solving the credit issue a puc order clarifying tha t dwr will get its money for power purchase costs note also that steve kean reminded me that weve got to continue to push to get the utilities out of the merchant function accordingly ive put a brief paragraph on that issue in the note to brulte in the last section legislative solution under the topic create a real competitive retail market in california to the best of my knowledge we dont have legislative language on that piece yet and it seems that well need to discuss it in considerably more depth before doing so if you have any questions about any of the materials in the email please dont hesitate to contact me or jim or sandi to discuss i can be best reached to day by pager at 8889167184 thanks to all for helping pull this together best jeff

developing smallscale generation on tribal lan ds our views on the impediments to distributed generation and suggestions on h ow to remove those impediments a description of the credit issues that continue to impede dwrs ability to sign contracts with power suppliers and options to resolve them two possible options for addressing the credit issue are 1 a california puc order clarifying that dwr will recover its power purchase costs through rates and 2 an amendment to ab1x designed to accomplish the same goal i have attached talking points regarding the california puc order and propose d amendments to ab1x we believe that an amendment to ab1x is the preferable option our assessment of the supplydemand picture in california our suggestions for a legislative package designed to solve both the near and longterm electricity crisis in california we will deliver to your office tomorrow detailed legislative language in those materials we will also identify existing bills that we believe can easily accommodate our proposed language i hope that the information is useful please do not hesitate to contact m e if you would like to discuss these materials further or if there is

standby charges solution the executive orders issued by the governor on february 14th took a step in the right direction utility standby charges have always been designed by the utilities to protect their monopoly position extract monopoly prices from customers or both but there is no reason to limit t he elimination of these charges to generation facilities that are less than 1mw these limits will only lengthen unnecessarily the time it takes for california to close the significant gap between supply and demand and reduc e the risk of black outs this summer we would propose lifting the cap by offering amendments to sb27x which is designed to facilitate development o f distributed generation excessive delays and costs related to interconnecting facilities with investorowned and municipal utilities solution the governors executive order regarding interconnection is a step in the right directiondd2601 requires utilities to complete interconnection studies within 7 days california should ensure that this requirement applies to all generation facilities including distributed generation in addition the financial conflicts the utilities face when interconnecting generation facilities are simply too powerful to overcome through executive orders or other regulations to the greatest extent possible california should shift control over interconnection away from th e utility and place that control with the california iso this could be accomplished through amendments to sb 27x permitting and air quality issues developers of distributed ie onsite generation that is 50 mws or greater must receive certification from the california energy commission an d therefore face all of the impediments to development that largescale generation faces solution california should ensure that the executive orders d2201 thru d2601 issued by the governor to expedite plant siting and maximize plant output apply equally to smaller scale distributed generation facil ities in addition distributed generation that is less than 50 mws continues to face local opposition the state should ensure that local parochial interests cannot block otherwise beneficial distributed generation projects these objectives could be accomplished through amendments to sb27x 3 credit concerns regarding authority granted to dwr in ab1x to purchase electricity on behalf of the utilities enron responded to the rfp issued by dwr to enter into power contracts with suppliers enron is in active discussions with dwr to establish contract terms with th e goal of entering into a power purchase agreement as soon as possible however ambiguities contained in ab1x have created significant credit risk concerns that need to be resolved in order to finalize contract terms we understand that the lions share of counterparties share enrons c redit risk concerns enron has proposed several options for resolving the credit risk issues and is working with dwr to arrive at a solution that is mutually agreeable to both sides and that might serve as a template for power purchase agreements going forward summary of the source of the credit risk issue ambiguous ratemaking authority the language in ab1x is ambiguous as to whether dwr has any authority to charge california ratepayers for the costs of purchasing power from our analysis of the bill the language in ab1x appears to leave intact the california pucs exclusive jurisdiction over ratemaking in california as such suppliers have no assurance that the puc will agree to include in rat es adequate charges to cover dwrs costs of power purchases ambiguous regulatory authority regarding contract prudence the language in ab1x leaves open the possibility that the california public utilities commission could determine that power purchases made by dwr are imprudent on the basis of such a finding the cpuc could then ref use to allow dwr to collect from ratepayers the costs associated with its power purchases consequently suppliers have no assurance that the puc will agr ee to include in rates the charges to cover the costs of power contracts that dwr has entered into with suppliers ambiguous language regarding the ratemaking mechanism that will be used to recover dwrs costs of power purchases in addition to the ambiguity regarding ratemaking and regulatory authority noted above the language in the bill is equally ambiguous with respect to the specific ratemaking mechanics that ab1x directs the puc to empl oy to permit dwr to recover its power purchase costs based on our analysis it i s extremely difficult to determine how the puc would design the rates to ensu re dwr recovers its power purchase costs moreover as currently drafted it is difficult to determine whether ab1x would even permit the puc to include in rates all of the charges necessary to fully recover dwrs power purchase costs again this ambiguity raises significant credit risk concerns since suppliers have little assurance that dwr will have the ability to recover from ratepayers the costs of purchasing power options to resolve concerns regarding credit risk we have been working diligently with dwr officials to resolve the credit ri sk issues we have identified three options amend ab1x the amendments which are attached to this email would clarify that a the puc would accept as prudent and reasonable all purchase costs incur red by dwr and b the puc is obligated to include in rates the charges necessary to ensure that dwr fully recovers its costs of power purchases this is the preferred option though we understand that the there may be some political challenges standing in the way of amending ab1x see attached file entitled amendab1xdoc clarify the ambiguities in ab1x through an order issued by the puc and through contract language this is the option that we are currently working with dwr officials to implement however it is more complicated and could take significantly mo re time to implement than the legislative fix we have attached electronic copies of the talking points related to the order that the california puc would need to issue under this option see attached file entitled cpuctalkingpointsdoc make use of other instruments designed to address credit risk as indicated in our letter responding to dwrs rfp we are willing to ac cept other forms of credit from dwr those options include a letter of credit cash prepayment or an acceptable form of collateral dwr officials have indicated to us that dwr prefers to pursue the second options that is dwr prefers to clarify the ambiguities in ab1x through a puc order and through contract amendments 4 californias supplydemand picture heading into summer 2001 both the california energy commission and cambridge energy research associates cera a private sector energy think tank have issued reports showing that california faces a severe supplydemand imbalance they diffe r only on how much and how soon additional supply will be made available al l credible sources agree that supply will be very tight throughout the summer of 2001 and that unless a solution is found immediately blackouts are likely cec and cera both forecast that california will be short of supply this summer by approximately 5000 mw these numbers are in line with our estimates californias supply base currently has a 6 capacity margin well below the average 1520 which is recommended for reliable system operatio n in the west since the west relies more heavily upon hydroelectric power than other regions reserves are particularly important owing to the unpredictability of the weather and the dry year the west has experienced t o date in the event of a low rain and snow period the system must possess t he flexibility to respond to the reduced availability of power supply californias very low reserve margin makes it especially susceptible to this requirement other reasons for reduced supply for the summer of 2001 include the early drawdown of reservoirs in the continual effort to manage californias seve re supplydemand gap emissions restrictions on existing plants and a reduced number of customers who can be curtailed under their contracts with the utilities cambridge energy research associates asserts that at the curren t pace of siting permitting and construction adequate supplies will not be added to correct the market imbalance until 2003 at the earliest cera predicts that california is likely to face approximately 20 hours of rolling black outs this summer the cec paints a considerably more optimistic scenario betting that california will bring an additional 5000 mws on line to meet peaking summer demand it is our view that california should view the cecs rosy scenario with considerable skepticism 5 suggested package of legislative proposals designed to solve california s electricity crisis this email offers an overview of our proposed legislative solution we wil l deliver to your office tomorrow specific legislative language and existing bills that we believe can accommodate our proposals as we have suggested throughout the crisis any solution to californias crisis must focus on four issues increase supply decrease demand establish a truly competitive retail electricity market return californias investorowned utilities to solvency increase supplylegislative vehicle sb28x sher to site and construct a power plant in texas takes approximately 2 years enron and others have completed the entire process in other states in less than a year in california it takes about six years or longer the governors executive orders and senator shers siting reform legi slation are steps in the right direction our suggested amendments can improve tho se efforts by further addressing the difficulties that project developers face in securing air emission reduction credits to meet the air permit requirements included in the cecs certification requirements enrons proposal seeks to streamline the process for 1 obtaining credits and 2 transfering credits between air districts in addition it creates an innovative emissions reduction bank to allow project sponsors to fund emissions in advance of obtaining certification and permits the affected a ir districts to use those funds to finance projects that will produce the required reductions in pollution emissions decrease demandlegislative vehicle ab31x wright because of the delay in getting a solution in place in california closing the supplydemand gap through energy conservation and efficiency offers the best chance of avoiding blackouts this summer this can be accomplished mo st effectively and quickly in two ways buydown demand california is tapping into an enormous amount of money from the general fun d to finance dwrs power purchases california could likely reduce demand more economically by running an auction to determine the payments businesses wou ld be willing to receive to reduce their demand for a sustained period eg through the summer months dwr could easily run an online auction to determine the price it could pay for these demand reductions to participate businesses would be required to have the metering equipment necessary to monitor and verify that they are actually achieving the reductions enron has developed an online auction software package d eal bench that it would be willing to contribute to the effort use price signals to incent voluntary curtailment to be successful customers need access to the following key elements an internet based hourahead price posting system to track the market price for hourahead power in real time realtime metering systems for baseline demand and voluntarily curtailment verification settlement process that allows for market clearing prices of energy to be paid for load reduction negawatts the potential benefits of an effective demand response program would includ e creation of additional summer peaking capacity in california parti cularly in the short term without requiring construction of additional generation resources reduction of peak or superpeak load on the overstressed california electric system thus potentially reducing the overall cost of electricity in the state fostering of demand elasticity without subjecting customers to the full ris k of hourly market price volatility by passing market price signals to customers and allowing them to voluntarily shed load and be compensated for responding we estimate that we could generate a summer 2001 onpeak demand response in excess of 400 mw during certain high cost hours and a demand response for summer 2002 onpeak hours that could exceed 1000 mw we further estimate that the market response to this program from all esps could be 2 to 3 time s that amount we recommend that the state of california provide rebates directly to customers to fund the installation of advanced metering and control systems that would support load curtailment implementation establish a truly competitive retail electricity marketlegislative vehi cle sb27x the only customers who were protected from price volatility in san diego we re customers who chose direct access and signed fixed price deals with energy service providers ironically ab1x takes that important option away from customers and businesses it is critical that ab1x be amended to remove th e prohibition against direct access enrons legislative proposal would give customers freedom to enter into a direct access transaction while simultaneously addressing the department o f water resources concerns about stranded power costs that might result from customer migration in addition california will only achieve a competitive retail market when the utility is removed completely from the procurement function procureme nt is not a utility core competency as evidenced by the dire financial condition in which the utilities now find themselves california should therefore begin immediately to phase the utility out of the procurement function entirely with the goal of having all customers served by a nonutility provider within 36 months to execute the transition california should hold a series of competitive solicitations over the 36month period in which competing service providers would bid for the right to serve segments of utility load return californias investorowned utilities to solvencylegislative vehicle ab18x utility bankruptcy will not increase supply and it will not decrease demand in short bankruptcy does nothing to solve californias supplydemand imbalance in addition bankruptcy increases the likelihood that consumers and businesses will bear the significant financial risks of having california state government assume the role of electricity buyer for an extended period of time finally bankruptcy will undermine both investor confidence in californias energy markets and the private sectors willingness to participate in that market california can return the utilities to financial solvency by implementing a series of staged rate increases california should design those rate increases with the dual goal of returning the utilities to solvency without shocking the economy or household budgets for example california could amortize the recovery of the utilities past debt over a 510 year period in addition the magnitude of the rate increase can be

bad not to express these opinions once i have learned with much interest that people envision solutions for international characters data exchange with a wider point of view than usually heard in the networking sphere i have been spending quite a time of my life with such problems i thought i could contribute with a small text explaining the way i have finally come to think of the problem nothing totally new probably but a different shed of light maybe the text may sound theoretical at first it is just terse the ideas are based on experience they have been put to use in the field of 8bit characters i participated to the design of kermit multinational 8bit characters support and the tcpip network i work for is well on the way towards the the same theory that every character on the communication line is iso 88591 any exception to this like translating ebcdic directly to pc code on one machine is considered harmful to our internetworking even if convenient every piece working towards a common well defined goal finally pays more when all parts start to clutch than wandering for immediate interest and i hope that saying that my language is french will make the ideas in a difficult to write text even more convincing despite being short networking has had for long the problem of a common representation of computerspecific data numbers bit strings on the wire rather on the connection because different computers had different conventions for them to solve this problem rules like xdr external data representation have been devised and because it was so important the rules have been adopted character data caused little problem because ascii was assumed full stop there was hardly an expressed rule it was tacit computer culture now that networking reaches its real dimension of an international mesh the problem of national languages usage becomes very real at least locally but more and more internationally any computer has to exchange more than ascii many generous people have spent much time to have system si with character code ci translate data for system sj with code cj under protocol pk with much respect for their work this is not no longer the way to do it supposing that n character codes exist on different systems the effort amounts to mn2 to reach a complete solution let us count the different character codes ibm have their share and protocols the bill is amazing the mostimportantpoint is that a single common representation code be defined fortheline suiting the purpose namely to cover all national languages in one single way and that people be instructed that every bit of text should travel in that code on the wire whatevertheprotocolis meaning that common tools be available to translate present local code it is best for a computer to use the code of interchange internally but all computers in the world cannot be modified overnight what computer si has to do to abide by the external representation is the sole matter of computer si to appear to others as if it were using it internally on any protocol the same way even during dialog with computer ti using the same code one need not know which kind of system one is sending mail to no tagging of the data nor any need to know any character code other than ones own and the interchange code the mn2 order of magnitude reduces to n this is the extended ascii culture of some future no doubt it is a very important goal just now it is a fact that the choice of a character code has long lasting effects because of the building software base the impact of todays decisions is amplified by time the sooner the better the better the sooner more theoretically said this time this localcode to exchangecode translation works much a la osi layer or a la if you dont mind data is encoded towards a lower layer exchanged and decoded back to same level but possibly to a different local code it probably belongs between level 6 and 7 as it could prove that the application layer provides all the textual data but thats not sure like for xdr which can be used from many levels to convert cpu data to line format should we merge presentation and representation layers split level 6 like level 2 or not assign it to any level ill leave the discussion to the theoricians what seems clear in my mind is that the translation is not in several final protocols but a protocol by itself like xdr that other protocols refer to and this may be the most important point it is a pity to see each protocol tackle the problem its own way note that the level 6 or so concept applied to text extends slightly beyond the representation of characters and binary data towards file structure think of the line separator problem of nfs for the basic case of text files while file structure including file name etc is clearly a specialized problem as opposed to communication of streams of text the impact on systems and protocols design is just as high clearly it will take much time to stand in asciis shoes but doing otherwise would take even longer to erase and redo one cannot increase complication eternally some intermediate compromises will have to be used like additional encoding on pathes some insist to not even try to convert to 8bit asking the rest of the networks to convert to 7bit instead and to rewrite all their programs to use a complicated method for sending plain text when the sole problem is that it contains 8bit data the important thing is that the new layer be known and used its the interest of both the software writer and buyer it will get void when a system will use the interchange code for itself now that the international character code iso 10646 is out isnt it time for communication systems to be able to not only exchange pictures and sound but also plain text will iso 10646 be used by osi 6 thanks for your interest i go away for holidays today if you write anything you want me to read please make a personal reply and allow for two weeks

ramanlabradormvusadobecom raman t v cc w3cmatherbw3org ive read the minutes of the last few meetings and daves proposal here are some comments 1 if you want to have a model for large or extendible characters i would like to suggest that we consider again the model of tex and the computer modern fonts barbara beeton of the ams has also done interesting work on math font layout in some iso workgroup 2 automatic numbering or better automatic generation of numbers labels from keys used in symbolic referencing a la labelref in latex or ididref in sgml is fraught with difficulties between lines ill include a piece i wrote about that in relation to the elsevier science dtds the problem of symbolic referencing has never been one of the dtds but one of finding an algorithm for deriving printed numberslabels from symbolic labels in the sgml source document earlier summary of the problem a generic mechanism for counters including some rules for presentation of counters is as follows every type of numbered object table figure equation reference has its own counter all toplevel counters start at the value 0 zero at the beginning of the document if nesting is possible every nesting level has its own counter counters of levels below toplevel start at the value 0 zero at the start tag of the next higher parent level from the values of the counters a label is calculated this label is eg printed in the article as it appears in a journal issue the relation between labels and counters is applicationdependent example sec id99 could be printed as 321 the values of the id attributes are unique within the document instance the id attribute is not identical to the counter value if the id attribute is missing the counter is not incremented and the element is not numbered this allows for eg unnumbered equations this means that tables and figures always have an id attribute even when they are not referenced or are there also cases where tables and figures are not numbered there are at least the following exceptions to the algorithm described above 1 the contents of a figure form one physical entity but inspection of the contents show that there are logical subfigures hidden inside the figure example the contents of figure2 contains markers a b and c which indicate logical subfigures 2a 2b and 2c 2 normal equation numbering 1 2 3 is interrupted by an equation number that is derived from an earlier one example 1 2 3 1 4 5 3 numbering in lists or subnumbering in equations is interrupted example a numbered list with items 1 2 3 is followed by a paragraph of text the is on the same level as the l and then the list continues 4 5 6 the intention of the author appears to be em one list but this list is interrupted a similar example can be found in equation subnumbering equations 4a and 4b are followed by a paragraph of text followed by equations 4c and 4d below i will discuss each case separately hidden subfigures when a figure as far as we know hidden subcomponents occur only with figures that exists as one physical entity consists of logical subentities the only solution lies in adding this information which lies outside the document to the document one possibility for this is to give the fig start tag a new attribute that specifies the labels of the individual components this enables generation of the labels of the subfigures first an example of a regular case fig idfig4 fig idfig4afiglnk filefig4afig fig idfig4bfiglnk filefig4bfig fig here the outer figure and the two nested figures each have their own unique key for referencing fig4 fig4a fig4b and we have the following id label pairs fig4 4 fig4a 4 1 fig4b 4 2 where the counter strings 4 1 and 4 2 are represented as 4a and 4b but this presentation is applicationdependent of course second an example of hidden subfigures fig idfig4 figlnk filefig4 fig the picture in fig4 contains two labels a and b that identify subfigures both the figure as a whole and the individual subfigures are referenced if we add an attribute to the start tag we can achieve this fig idfig4 compa bgt the keys fig4a and fig4b are implied automatically generated these implied keys act as aliases for fig4 since they refer to the same physical object unfortunately the attribute compa b also suggests a presentation now we have the following id label pairs fig4 4 fig4a 4 1 fig4b 4 2 where 4 4 1 and 4 2 refer to the same object physical figure in the document instance derived equation numbers we illustrate this case with an example suppose an article contains the following sequence of equations 1 2 3 1 4 5 in that case we have the following id label pairs for the first three equations eq1 1 eq2 2 eq3 3 the next equation should have an id label pair like this eq1 labeleq1 where eq1 is the unique id assigned to equation1 and labeleq1 stands for the label of the equation with ideq1 and the next equation 4 should have an id label pair like this eq4 4 the question is whether appending material to an existing label is the only form of derivation or whether other forms of derivation exist interrupted sequences this case occurs with list items within a numbered list or with numbered subequations lists look like a special case of nesting numbering of list items normally starts with 1 but every list item must have an verbid that is unique within the document this could be achieved if we also numbered the parent element verblgt suppose we have l li idliaa footnote is li idlibfootnotes should be l a paragraph of text comes between the two numbered lists l li idlica figure is li idlida table is l and the author has numbered the list items as 1 2 3 4 we agreed earlier that one of the guiding principles is to follow the author unless there are errors in the manuscript 3 htmlmath is intended to allow as well as rendering to graphical bitmapped displays what about rendering to paper 4 there are hundreds of symbols in use in mathematics for those of you who think this is covered by unicode computer modern fonts and the ams fonts although the latter are very useful should study pages 4750 of the following document ftpftpelseviernlpubsgmlartdocpsgz this is the documentation of our article dtd and it contains tables with all symbols and characters we use in typesetting our products there is redundancy in it i know but more important is that to cover this set 100 you need more than the font sets i mentioned earlier elsevier science is in discussion with several societies about the possibility of completing a font set that covers all this and perhaps more and make it freely available this will also solve legal problems with embedding fonts or parts of fonts in pdf files 5 superiorsinferiors i think we should add something about vertical position of inferiors in mathematics and chemistry these differ as some of you may know 6 in the list of layout idioms i believe there is at least one missing namely an arrow that adjusts its width to the text appearing above or below it this is used in chemical formulas and is different from an arrow or brace as ornament that adjusts its width to the text underneath it examples of both widebracea b c x y z the brace is the ornament catalyst a b the text above the arrow is the ornament 7 in example 2 a lot of reserved words occur from to of how do you get these words as normal words in the text in roman 8 what about coding fractions are we going to follow latex and most sgml dtds and use something like fraction numerator denominator or are we copying the horrible tex construct over ive been asked by people on the latex3

 a defense of michael moore and bowling for columbine opedby eloquence wed aug 13th 2003 at 090009 am est this is an open letter to david hardy author of bowling for columbine documentary or fiction probably the most comprehensive among many rebuttals of the oscarwinning documentary critics have now gone so far as to call for the revocation of the award their chances are small however as their arguments rely on polemic exaggeration and misrepresentation in other words on the same techniques which they accuse moore of using dear david hardy it is fascinating to watch the organized character assassination of michael moore that has been going on in the united states since the release of his last documentary in a time of simpleminded patriotism loud clear and dissenting voices like mr moores are perceived as disturbing and have to be silenced partially through well funded public relations campaigns partially through conservative grassroots propaganda not surprisingly much of the criticism of moores film is misguided or outright wrong often vastly more inaccurate than moores work itself moore portrays the nra as an unethical dishonest organization he sees the paranoia and fear in the united states as a primary cause of violence and he does not see gun ownership itself as a problem his documentary is full of subtle humor jawdropping dialogue and dark contrasts all in all it is an accurate portrayal of americas gun and violence culture it also raises questions about americas foreign policy of recent decades questions which have been all but ignored by moores critics on your webpage you state that moores resolution is questionable after all early in the movie he discards the possibility that playing violent video games and watching violent flicks can cause violence because canadians like and japanese positively love those if violent movies and violent videogames cannot cause violence then how can newscasts about violence do so this is a faulty generalization if as moore implies although never states as fact video games and violent movies are relatively harmless it does not logically follow that all types of media presentation are harmless there is a huge difference for example between playing a game like quake and listening to a radio broadcast that tells you that your family will be killed unless you take action to kill others now the latter is the kind of media propaganda that was used to unleash a genocide in rwanda in 1994 which killed 800000 people similarly the main motivation for the crusades beyond the promise of wealth was that christians were supposedly being slaughtered and had to be saved obviously media propaganda can incite people to kill interactive fiction like video games on the other hand presents violence in a narrative context which may very well desensitize participants to said violence but no causative link has ever been proven moores hypothesis which apparently comes at least in part from the book culture of fear by barry glassner also advertised on moores website is that the constant bombardment with messages of fear can incite paranoia which itself can lead to violent acts this is consistent with the kind of mediaincited violence described above and in no relationship whatsoever to the theory of video game or music incited violence it is no surprise however that us and european media do not question their own propaganda of fear moores second hypothesis is that americas foreign policy may contribute to the belief that violence is an appropriate means to solve conflicts a hypothesis which is shared by many sociologists and psychologists children who grow up in wartorn regions are known for having similar views war is perceived as a normal part of existence violence as a natural way to solve disputes in a weaker sense the same message is projected to american children who grow up being told that it is not acceptable to be violent to one another but who simultaneously have to endure corporal punishment and media messages about how the enemies of freedom are punished moores film was made before the dead bodies of qusay and uday hussein were paraded on national tv americans were gloating over this demented corpse show they squealed like little piggies too so youll have to make do with oink oink squeeeeeeeallll for their last words that goes for your grandson mustafa too by the way still think fucking with the us was a good idea sammy mustafa was 14 years when he was killed americans cheer the killing of children yet wonder why their own children grow up to be more violent than those in other nations it is paradoxical notions like this one which moores film seeks to address inaccuracies your webpage list a number of alleged inaccuracies in moores movies it is true that moores film is sometimes unintentionally deceptive but to call it fraudulent is hyperbole to the extreme it is no more so than any other successful documentary of the last decades lets look at some specific criticisms 1 the bank scene listed on your website on a separate page critics have stated that this scene was staged but in the bank interview the official tells moore that the bank has its own vault storing about 500 weapons at any given time it is also a licensed firearms dealer which can perform its own background checks in an interview with the wall street journal linked from your site an employee claims that the gun would have been normally picked up at another dealer it is not explained what normally is supposed to mean but that claim flatly contradicts the statement of the bank official in the film this sounds more like a later correction for public relations purposes but of course nobody questions the bank claims when they can be used against moore the only thing that moore compressed is the timeframe according to the same wsj interview typically youre looking at a week to 10 days waiting period this is plausible but entirely irrelevant for the movie which already makes it quite clear that a background check is being performed moores detractors have sometimes extended those 710 days to several weeks contradicting the banks own estimate there is nothing inaccurate whatsoever about the bank scene the bank does exactly what it advertises it hands out guns from its vault to those who open an account the silly criticisms of the scene obscure the real obscenity of the situation a bank handing out guns to its customers higlighting the utter laxness of how americans deal with deadly weapons and a love of firearms that borders on the religious 2 the lockheedmartin interview this is perhaps the criticism repeated the most often and it also the most inaccurate first the actual quotes from the film are often reproduced incorrectly the dialogue goes as follows moore so you dont think our kids say to themselves gee dad goes off to the factory every day he builds missiles these are weapons of mass destruction whats the difference between that mass destruction and the mass destruction over at columbine high school mccollum pr person i guess i dont see that specific connection because the missiles that youre talking about were built and designed to defend us from somebody else who would be aggressors against us first note the word our in moores question moore is not from colorado his question is generic not meant to refer specifically to the lockheed martin plant in question mccollum understands it this way otherwise he would protest against the plant being mischaracterized however critics of moore have cleverly ignored mccollums response and presented moore as spreading lies about the lockheed plant even lockheed did not believe the public to be that gullible in response to one moore detractor mccollum wrote although other units of lockheed martin corporation elsewhere in the country produce weapons to support the defense of the us we make no weapons at the littletonarea facility moore visited of course critics have conveniently ignored the fact that lockheed martin does supply weapons of mass destruction to the us military and that the company is the nations largest military contractor as moore correctly points out it is bizarre for a society to openly embrace the production of destructive weapons but on the other hand see no connection of this to everyday violence children learn by imitating adults yes moore makes this point through slight exaggeration by moving with the camera through the lm plant but he makes no incorrect statement it is typical for his critics to jump on what is at most a slightly misleading implication but in doing so they themselves have unlike moore made many incorrect claims 3 denver nra meeting critics like yourself claim that moore has massively distorted evidence to support his point that charlton heston has effectively insulted the victims of the columbine tragedy by holding a rally in denver shortly afterwards first the from my cold dead hands part this is used by moore as a visual citation to introduce heston it is perhaps one of his most famous quotes shown on national tv even here in germany it tells viewers aha this is the person we are talking about nowhere does moore say or imply that these words were uttered at the rally in denver and in fact their reptition later in the movie at another occasion oddly claimed by critics to be again misattributed is simply a reminder of this it is moores way to say viewers meet charlton heston gun nut extraordinaire the visual of a billboard and a narration is viewed by you as evidence that moore is trying to somehow tie the two events together when in reality it is quite obvious that he does it to separate the introduction of heston from his speech in denver moore is a professional filmmaker he concentrates on maximum impact of each of the statements he cites and to accomplish that effect uses subtle interludes instead of longwinded introductions this is a common technique but because conservative readers are not familiar with the basics of filmmaking they believe critics who claim that he is distorting the interview what he does is standard filmmaking practice the same goes for the interview which follows moores critics would expect us to have him quote heston in his entirety have him present fully the pr that the nra has used to justify its rally in denver for reasons of balance the nra was fully aware of the scandal it would cause through its rally and decided to push on because they believed to have enough media support to successfully do so they were right you claim that there was no way to change location since you have to give advance notice of that to the members and there were upwards of 4000000 members 10 days are more than enough to give advance warning of a change in location or date had the nra really wanted to it is probably correct that their primary reason for not doing so was to save money not to piss off the victims of colubmine that does not change the fact that they did just that moore presents the most important part of the speech to back up this point and ignores the fluff this is what good documentary filmmaking is about and here the critics again ignore important evidence when heston mentions the mayor of denver the crowd boos loudly heston maganimously holds up a hand to read the mayors letter only to explain in detail why he chose to ignore the request not mentioning at all the reasons you have given this booing by the crowd not mentioned with a single word in your transcript or your article shows that the crowd was fully aware of the controversy they would cause by coming to littleton after children were being killed there and they effectively said fuck you to say that they could not have done otherwise is a bold lie by moores critics 4 the kayla rolland case again critics like yourself charge moore with deception the rally took place on october 17 the shooting on february 29 again standard filmmaking techniques are interpreted as smooth distortion moore works by depriving you of context and guiding your mind to fill the vacuum with completely false ideas it is brilliantly if unethically done as noted above the from my cold dead hands part is simply moores way to introduce heston did anyone but moores critics view it as anything else he certainly does not attribute it to a speech where it was not uttered and as noted above doing so twice would make no sense whatsoever if moore was the mastermind deceiver that his critics claim he is concerning the georgetown hoya interview where heston was asked about rolland you write there is no indication that heston recognized kayla rollands case this is naive to the extreme heston would not be president of the nra if he was not kept up to date on the most prominent cases of gun violence even if he did not respond to that part of the interview he certainly knew about the case at that point regarding the nra website excerpt about the case and the highlighting of the phrase 48 hours after kayla rolland is pronounced dead this is one valid criticism but far from the deliberate distortion you make it out to be rather it is an example for how the facts can sometimes be easy to miss with moores fast pace editing the reason the sentence is highlighted is not to deceive the viewer into believing that heston hurried to flint to immediately hold a rally there as will become quite obvious but simply to highlight the first mention of the name kayla rolland in the text which is in this paragraph unfortunately because the zooming is rather fast it is easy to miss the rest of the sentence so as you correctly note some viewers got an incorrect impression it would have been fair for moore to point out this possible misinterpretation on his website however the claim of deliberate distortion is ludicrous for several reasons a moore clearly states that before he came to flint heston gave an interview in the excerpt from said interview we can see that it is from march if moore wanted to deceive his viewers why would he say this and show the month the interview was published b why should moore leave the words clinton is on the today show visible in the text which is necessary to correctly interpret the highlighted part i reviewed the sequence several times and it is perfectly possible to see this text without pausing c both the soccer mom interview and the sequences showing the nra rally make no effort to distort the fact that this rally happened months after the fact the camera lingers on bushcheney posters and the protestor is quoted as saying that we wanted to let the nra know that we havent forgotten about kayla rolland you make the hysterical claim that the interview may be faked on the basis that no name is shown for the interviewee but if moore had faked it why the hell should he put this sentence in the protestors mouth which directly contradicts the conclusion that the rally happened hours after kaylas death why did moore the masterful deveiver not edit this sequence out this makes no sense opinions may vary on how tasteless it was for heston to hold a pro gun rally on the location of the nations youngest school shooting months after the fact but this sequence of bowling is without doubt the most unfair to heston the claims of deliberate distortion dont hold up when viewing the whole scene though as hanlons razor states one should never attribute to malice what can be attributed to incompetence the somewhat inept editing of the nra press release has led some viewers to wrong conclusions which is unfortunate but moores critics have no interest in viewing the matter fairly had they done so moore himself would probably have apologized for the gaffe in any case at no point does moore make a false statement in contradiction to claims by critics that his documentary is full of lies 5 you write having created the desired impression moore follows with his heston interview no he doesnt you accuse moore so often of changing the chronology yet you have no problems changing it yourself the heston interview is at the very end of the movie after the flint rally comes a brief tv interview with heston where he is asked about kayla rolland again clear evidence that the local media in flint raised questions about the nras presence then an inteview with country prosecutor arthur busch entirely ignored by critics of the film who also mentions hestons presence as notable and refers to the immediate reactions of people from all over america gun ownersgroups who according to him reacted aggressively to warnings of having guns accessible to children much like spanking advocates react aggressively when antispankers point to a case of a child being killed or severely injured by a beating these people do not feel the need to express sympathy or to think about ways to avoid such incidents but they feel the need to assert their rights and to look for quick simple answers as busch states gun owners wanted to hang the child from the highest tree this is all not mentioned by critics of moores movie who claim to be objective perhaps the best example of the paranoia surrounding moores film is your subessay is the end of the heston interview itself faked moore answers a simple question how could the scene have been filmed with a simple answer two cameras from this you construct an obscure conspiracy of reenactment for all we can tell moore could have shouted hey to make heston turn around and then remained silent as heston left even if your reenactment theory is true and i see no evidence that you have actually tried to ask the people involved in the filmmaking for their opinion this itself is not unethical and you have no evidence whatsoever that moore has done anything unethical here just like you have no evidence that moore has unethically removed parts of the interview you use standard filmmaking technique as a basis to construct bizarre conspiracies which sound plausible to the gullible reader without ever providing any evidence for the implicit or explicit claims of fraud and distortion 6animated history of the us of course the cartoon is highly oversimplified and most critics consider it one of the weakest parts of the film but it makes a valid claim which you ignore entirely that the strategy to promote gun rights for white people and to outlaw gun possession by black people was a way to uphold racism without letting an openly terrorist organization like the kkk flourish did the 19th century nra in the southern states promote gun rights for black people i highly doubt it but if they didnt one of their functions was to continue the racism of the kkk this is the key message of this part of the animation which is again being ignored by its critics 7 buell shooting in flint you write fact the little boy was the class thug already suspended from school for stabbing another kid with a pencil and had fought with kayla the day before this characterization of a sixyearold as a pencilstabbing thug is exactly the kind of hysteria that moores film warns against it is the typical rightwing reaction which looks for simple answers that do not contradict the republican mindset the kid was a little bastard and the parents were involved in drugs case closed but why do people deal with drugs because its so much fun to do so it is by now well documented that the cia tolerated crack sales in us cities to fund the operation of south american contras it is equally well known that the socalled war on drugs begun under the nixon administration is a failure which has cost hundreds of billions and made america the world leader in prison population both in relative and absolute numbers in poor areas the highly profitable drug business obviously is often seen as the last resort but the real cause here are not the drugs themselves but poverty and the war on drugs had the boys mother not been shipped to a welfare to work program she might at least have had some time to spend with her son virtually every child psychologist knows that motherchild bonding is essential for the development of empathy and social abilities the awareness of the consequences of ones actions and the learning of conflict resolution by nonviolent means even the official quoted by moore blames the welfare to work program knowing full well that the drug issue is a red herring once again your emphasis on the little boy as a thug confirms moores and buschs assertion that people wanted to hang the child from the highest tree instead of looking at the real causes thats because while there is a socalled war on drugs there is no war on poverty poverty is frequently portrayed as natural and the poor in america are seen by conservatives as vcrowners who are just too lazy to work in reality what moore describes here is the most vivid example of what can only be called wage slavery i have ever seen to the detriment of families it is notable that the wall street journals reaction to this segment of the film was even more dismissive than yours it called moores claim preposterous how could he even think about blaming poverty and forced labor programs for anything bad that happens 8 taliban and american aid after the september 11 attacks it was necessary for conservatives to somehow explain away the fact that the us government gave 245 million dollars to the new evildoers du jour never mind the fact that authors such as robert scheer warned of aiding the taliban as early as in may 2001 never mind that they did so not out of some humanitarian motivation but because of the talibans violent enforcement of the ban on opium poppies never mind that in a regime that is controlled by warlords it does not matter who is authorized to distribute the aid the ruling regional warlords will seize control of it and use it to their own advantage never mind that this very argument has been used by hawks in opposition to sending humanitarian aid to iraqs saddam hussein never mind that the taliban continued selling opium in spite of the deal never mind that this is all documented on michael moores website about the film 9 gun homicides statistics are moores weakest point and it is surprising that his critics dont dwell on them longer thats because they know all too well that moore is correct the united states have a far greater homicide rate both gun and nongun than most other first world countries his main mistake is that he does not use population corrected data his second mistake is that he does not cite his sources and as you correctly point out he probably uses different reporting methods for the different countries a good comparison of international homicide rates can be found on the relatively neutral guncitecom website not surprisingly guncite too compares data from different years as i know from personal experience it is quite difficult to do comparisons of crime statistics due to differences in reporting frequency and methodology the gun homicide rates for the countries moore mentioned according to guncite are japan 002 per 100000 1994englandwales 011 per 100000 1997germany 022 per 100000 1994australia 044 per 100000 1994united states 372 per 100000 1999 critics fail to credit moore with not making the same mistake that some gun control advocates make concluding that gun ownership leads to violence in fact moore mentions several counterexamples and more such counterexamples can indeed be cited it is intuitively obvious that guns do not actually cause violence but it is equally intuitively obvious that they make the violence that is committed more deadly it is the second intuition which gun rights groups like the nra seek to obscure using fraudulent data by the likes of john mary lott the gun control movement on the other hand distracts from the real causes of violence poverty paranoia the war on drugs and antisexuality if these causes were addressed gun ownership in the united states would not be a problem but also unnecessary just like it is in switzerland 10 canada ammunition purchase you write bowling shows moore casually buying ammunition at an ontario walmart he asks us to look at what i a foreign citizen was able to do at a local canadian walmart he buys several boxes of ammunition without a question being raised thats right i could buy as much ammunition as i wanted in canada canadian officials have pointed out that the buy is faked or illegal once again you fail to distinguish between regular film editing and faking a word which canadian officials have never used for such a distortion moore would have been boiled alive by his critics if moore simply chose not to show how he revealed his identification to the salesperson there is nothing fraudulent about that he made no claims whatsoever in the film about the need to show or not show identification his claim that it is possible to purchase ammunition in supermarkets is independent from that claim 11 hestons allegedly implied racism you conclude from hestons own words that heston was somehow portrayed as racist if anything it is his own failure that he did not clarify what he meant with having a more mixed ethnicity hestons answers in the interview were evasive and unhelpful while this can in part be explained with his age and mental condition if he is unable to defend the interests of the nra he should not be their spokesman in this case hanlons razor can be applied to heston he is probably not racist but incompetent your accusations of inappropriate cutting are once again entirely unsupported in fact it is quite clear from watching that particular scene that there is not a single cut from the point at which moore asks heston a second time for the cause of the higher violence in the states and the point when he mentions the kayla rolland incident if heston makes himself look like a fool that should hardly be blamed on michael moore conclusion you write bowling for columbine is dishonest it is fraudulent to trash heston it even uses the audiovideo editor to assemble a heston speech that heston did not give and sequences images and carefully highlighted text to spin the viewers mind to a wrong conclusion none of this is true what is true is that bowling for columbine is a diamond in the small world of big screen documentaries one that shines brightly and illuminates an often misunderstood aspect of american culture it is not a flawless diamond the 48 hours scene in particular suffers from bad editing the statistics are suboptimal and heston gets a bit more bashing than he deserves other than towards the nra the movie tries hard to avoid simplistic conclusions and comes up with some thoughtful answers the most shameful part of the ongoing attacks against moore is that these answers have been all but ignored by his critics had moore wanted to make a propaganda film he would have used other material photos from americas emergency rooms certainly moore is one of the most talented filmmakers in the united states today and his film fully deserved its oscar the shrill and remarkably unsuccessful internet campaign to revoke his award seems to be motivated more by jealousy than by real concerns about the films accuracy it is not only the highest grossing nonmusic documentary of all time among the users of the largest internet film database imdb it is also the highest rated one according to the la times the documentary genre owes a huge debt to michael moore after bowlings success films like spellbound and capturing the friedmans were taken seriously and shown in many more theatres than otherwise likely but perhaps the campaign against moore is really motivated by another reason his next project has the working title fahrenheit 911 the temperature at which freedom burns and he intends to launch it shortly before the next us presidential election it is unlikely however that the unfair attacks against him will have much of an impact after all the same kind of pr blitz was started against the previous recordholding documentary roger me by michael moore yours sincerely erik mller this text is in the public domain 
 proposal for a red harvester ant robot colony infiltration and task switching sonia roberts 112707 introduction background science fiction writers have been anticipating humanoid androids that could pass a turing test for years unfortunately as of yet no robot has managed to fool a human for more than a few seconds and no robot has been created that can integrate itself into human society infiltrating insect societies however is much simpler extensive research has been done on the interactions of social insects such as honeybees ants and cockroaches and in fact robots have passed undetected in cockroach society performing single simple behaviors already halloy et al 2007 no robot has yet been constructed however that could pass undetected within a colony of the red harvester ants species pogonomyrmex barbatus nor has a robot managed to pass undetected in a society of insects while combining in its design several different behaviors and the thresholds of stimulation required to switch between them such a robot would allow for both longterm studies of antrobot interactions and studies of taskswitching in the robots i propose here the theoretical construction and programming of a robot hereafter referred to as antie that will be able to infiltrate a red harvester ant nest switching between the foraging patrolling and midden work behaviors environment the red harvester ant lives in hot dry deserts building its nests in light yellowy sand and foraging for seeds deposited by winds and rain the ants forage for more than 30 different varieties of seeds many of which do not grow in the desert gordon 54 where only a few varieties of small shrubs small herbaceous flowering plants and short grasses do grow gordon 51 other insects and creatures including other species of ants are present in the desert but red harvester ants seem to be relatively undisturbed by these animals gordon 711 though fights sometimes do break out with other red harvester ants from different nests intraspecies interactions tend not to be aggressive gordon 11 because of this i will ignore other ant species in the design of antie and will not create a fighting behavior antie will be equipped to navigate in this environment and will be designed to find seeds in sandy soil the ant the robot ants of this species are of two types breeding ants queens and drones and sterile female workers queens and drones will not be considered in this proposal as their behaviors and design is much more specialized and would be applicable only during the breeding season which occurs but once per year the behaviors of the sterile workers may be divided into several subcategories brood care nest maintenance patrolling and foraging little is known about brood care as this occurs only in the deepest regions of the nest and observation would generally require the destruction of the nest nest maintenance and seed processing are likewise difficult to observe in the deeper regions of the nest but the sorting and deposition of waste dirt and nest garbage outside of the nest midden work occurs close enough to the surface to be observable patrolling and foraging too occur for the most part outside of the nest and have therefore been studied extensively ex schafer et al 2006 gordon et al 2002 gordon 2002 gordon 1987 it is therefore these three behaviors that i would like to focus on in this proposal the others remain a bit too mysterious to yet model and the ability of a robot to pass undetected in the depths of a colony would be very difficult to observe these three behaviors each present different puzzles to the ant and to the modeler though there is some overlap particularly with navigational problems in the case of midden work antie must be able to identify garbage grasp it carry it out of the nest and deposit it about halfway down the mound before returning to repeat the process ad infinitum or until stimulated to switch behaviors patrolling may be divided into two distinct subbehaviors nest patrolling and trail patrolling an ant engaged in nest patrolling must exit the nest at the proper time in the morning and wander about for a bit on the nest mound presumably taking measurements of the temperature and humidity in some way and making sure that it is safe for the other ants to exit perhaps the level of degradation of the nest patrollers cuticular hydrocarbons after this short foray into the sun and heat acts as an indication of the outside conditions to the foragers who may then upon smelling the returning patroller be stimulated either to forage or to remain inactive inside the nest an ant engaged in trail patrolling must exit the nest wander around searching for food sources identify food upon discovery and return to the nest to show the foragers where the food is this is thought to be accomplished by the deposition of chemical markers from a gland on the abdomen that the patroller drags along the ground on her return route to the nest that the foragers may then follow gordon 3334 holldobler et al 1990 as cited in webb 1998 in addition to following these trails to the food foragers must also be able to identify food grasp it and carry it back to the nest ants engaged in all three behaviors must be able to identify other nestmates and their current tasks as well as indicate to other ants their own nestmate status and current task walk navigate both within and outside of the nest and of course switch tasks at appropriate times the agent chassis antie will be implemented on a tiny road warrior robotic system behaviors will be coded in interactive c for which some pseudocode is included sensors will include a thermometer photoreceptors bump sensors a polarization compass and a series of chemical receptors antie be a circular robot no more than 1cm in diameter the length of a red harvester ant with two driving wheels and one rear wheel for stabilization a gripper will be located on the front of the robot consisting of two elongated tongs antie will also feature a skirt of bump sensors sonar detectors and chemical emitters including sacs of hydrocarbons extracted from ants of the nest being infiltrated and pheromones for successful patrolling and foraging these sacs will be refilled at a filling station each morning as antie determines that they are getting depleted antie will likewise recharge at a special station at night just inside the nest entrance for the purposes of this proposal i will assume that antie has enough battery life to remain powered the whole day a rudimentary blueprint of antie is attached fig 1 sensors in order to inform itself about its environment antie will need a number of sensors in an attempt to mimic the red harvester ant as closely as possible these sensors include a thermometer photoreceptors bump sensors and sonar a polarization compass and a series of chemical receptors on a pair of stalks corresponding to the antennae on its front grippers antie will have a tactile skin to sense pressure the locations of the rest of these sensors will depend on their function the thermometer will be located on the rear of the robot to keep it out of the way and will detect and input to the robot the outside temperature in degrees celsius harvester ants do not exit the nest when the outside temperature is above 52 degrees celsius gordon 9 and the ability to use a temperature gradient will enable innest navigation antie will also be equipped with one photoreceptor located in the middle of the top of its chassis corresponding to the ants eyes these will be useful for initiating patrolling behavior in the morning and shutting off behaviors at night the patrollers first poke their heads out of the nest shortly after sunrise and scuttle back in at night gordon 5 the bump sensors and sonar will form a skirt around antie to keep it from colliding with other objects the sonar will constantly be detecting nearby objects and initiate an escape maneuver when their inputs pass a certain threshold of stimulation and the bump sensors will when depressed also initiate the escape function the sonar will correspond to the ants limited optical object detection ability and the bump sensors will allow the robot to detect collisions the polarization compass will consist of two polarized light sensors placed at 45 and 45 degrees from the center front of antie respectively that will orient antie towards a desired polarization pattern these sensors would correspond to the cells in the ants eyes sensitive to polarized light and research has shown that many insects including ants do navigate using a path integration system synthesizing input from a polarization compasses and from a sort of odometer labhart et al 2002 antie would use a system for processing the input from its polarization compass based on the compass designed by lambrinos moller labhart pfeifer and wehner in 2000 consisting of two photodiodes with blue filters and polarizers fig 2 the difference of their logarithmized signals would be returned to antie who will use a simultaneous model to navigate returns to the nest upon each exit from the nest antie will take a single 360o scan of the sky and will orient itself according to an analytical procedure to derive compass information from different polarization patterns perceived later this should be sufficient to return antie to the nest given the accuracy achieved by lambrinos et al and the relatively short periods of time that harvester ants spend outside the nest before returning fig 2 diagram of the polarizationopponent unit described by lambrinos et al 2000 the unit takes in polarization levels through the two polarizationsensitive photodiodes and feeds them into the logarithm ratio amplifier which returns the difference of the logarithmized signals from the photodiodes the evector heading returned from the two polarizationsensitive photodiodes 1 2 follows a cos2function ants themselves rely primarily on chemical information taken in through their antennae and to mimic this antie will have chemical sensing and emitting stalks with which to both interact with other ants who may be surprised to find an ant without antennae and take in chemical information these stalks will need to have receptors to measure the nalkene levels present in another ants cuticular hydrocarbons which research indicates is the marker for harvester ants of a nestmates current task perhaps because the hydrocarbons are altered in the dry sun causing a different ratio of nalkanes to nalkenes and the presence of branched nalkanes in the hydrocarbon profile wagner et al 2001 as cited in gordon greene 2003 anties stalks would also have receptors for the hydrocarbons themselves which research shows indicate to the ants whether another ant is their nestmate arnold et al 1996 as cited in gordon mehdiabadi 1999 receptors to detect food and receptors for three types of pheromones those released by successful foragers returning with food those released by successful patrollers returning to the nest and those marking piles of trash as midden research shows that successful foragers returning to the nest do have a different effect on the inactive workers than unsuccessful foragers returning schafer et al 2006 returning successful patrollers have an even greater effect on foraging activity foragers will not leave the nest unless a patroller returns gordon 2002 and the rate of foraging in a colony can be controlled by rolling glass beads coated with cuticular hydrocarbons extracted from patrollers into the nest gordon greene 2003 greene gordon 2007 midden seems to be marked in some olfactory way since removing midden from nests makes them more likely to be invaded by other species gordon 35 for the purposes of this proposal i will assume that the nest maintenance and food processing ants have marked the midden with a particular pheromone all of these chemical receptors will be arranged in an array on a pair of chemical stalks with four of each type of receptor per stalk this technique described by ishida et al 2001 has been shown to improve the chemical plumetracking abilities of robots the wires will lead back down through the stalk to the onboard pc finally antie will have tactile sensors on its grippers to analyze the pressure being exerted on a gripped object these sensors will be of the type patented by peterson et al patent 4492949 and will feature several layers of electrically insulating and parallel flexible conductive rods arranged such that an exerted pressure may be measured in output voltage these will correspond to the muscles of the ants mandibles which provide sensorimotor feedback to the ant when grasping objects a table of the sensors and their relation to the ants sensory system is provided below fig 3 table of sensors and their relations to the ant sensor relation to ant placement on antie function sonar detectors eyes object perception skirt prevent object collisions thermometer ants respond to different temperatures rear innest navigation tells antie when to stop engaging in extranest activity

is a seed or not polarized photoreceptors retina 45 and 45 degrees from center on top polarization compass midden pheromone chemical receptors antennae stalks determine whether an object is midden or not motors anties motors will allow it to move around and interact with its environment and fellow ants there will be two individually operated motors to drive the two side wheels in lieu of legs two simultaneously operated motors will open and close the grippers emulating the grasping power of the ants mandibles a third motor will lift and lower the grippers allowing antie to raise and lower gripped items as an ant would by raising and lowering its head three small sprayers will emit successful patroller and forager pheromones and cuticular hydrocarbons from the appropriate sacs these will be located in different places the sprayer for the successful patroller pheromone will be located on the rear at the base of antie corresponding to the glands that researchers believe the ants drag along behind them to mark returning paths while the successful forager and cuticular hydrocarbon sprayers will be located on the skirt antie will not spray different pheromones depending on its task on the assumption that its time in the sun will alter its hydrocarbons enough that its tasks will be recognizable to other ants almost all motor output will be a direct function of sensory input as indicated in the following section the behavior antie will have a hybrid software architecture a subsumption hierarchy will be responsible for switching between behaviors but many subbehaviors will operate on a schema basis pseudocode will approximate this architecture as closely as possible and where appropriate different subroutines running on a schema basis will be marked common behaviors a few subbehaviors will be necessary for more than one behavior to ease anties onboard memory requirements and processing capabilities and to make all the rest of the pseudocode easier for the reader to understand i propose a few global variables and subroutines the following global variables will be used throughout the pseudocode and are compiled here for ease of reference number representing

activation status as forager common behaviors will include a forward cruise and turning mechanism procedures to determine the orientation towards nest and the distance from the nest when outside innest navigation an escape function for when objects are detected or bumped into object identification and gripping a generic algorithm for pheromone plume and chemical trail following and the identification of other ants for a simple start the forward cruise function will merely take in a double integer representing a speed and cause antie to move forward at this speed forward cruise takes in a number representing the desired speed causes robot to cruise forward at said speed speeds assumed to be on a 110 scale 10 being fastest void forcruzdouble speed each wheel input gets the appropriate speed calibrate is a double representing a calibration initialized to zero and altered as necessary the robot will receive the go command as long as this function is running leftmotorop speed calibrate rightmotorop speed end forcruz a similar rotate function will be used to orient antie towards a particular heading rotate takes in a desired angle to rotate the robot and rotates accordingly assume that 10s is sufficient to rotate the robot completely around one wheel this may be changed in implementation void rotateint angle if angle to turn is to the right rotate left wheel for a portion of 10s in accordance with desired angles proportion of a circle ifangle0 while timer 10 angle 360 leftmotorop 5 rightmotorop 0 else rotate right wheel for appropriate portion of 10s else while timer 10 angle 360 leftmotorop 0 rightmotorop 5 end while end else end rotate these behaviors will often be used in other subroutines running on a schema basis and when combined with the forward cruise function should cause the robot to move at an angle in order to orient itself toward the nest while navigating outside antie will need to determine which direction the nest is in and rotate toward that heading and also how far from the nest it is at its current location the orientation and distance should be calculable by the polarization pattern according to the system set up by lambrinos et al antie will therefore have a polarization function that will return a compass direction toward which it should orient in order to return home to the nest and a distance function that will return the shortest direct distance we may assume that this first function will return a direction in degrees positive or negative and that the second function will return a distance in centimeters the first function might look something like this nest orient takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs and returns the location of the nest in degrees int nestorientdouble leftpolip double rightpolip int degrees 0 calculates direction of nest and returns as degrees return degrees end nestorient the second function which would return the distance in centimeters might look something like this nest distance takes in the polarization sensitive photo diode inputs and returns the current distance to the nest int nestdistdouble leftpolip double rightpolip int dist 0 calculates distance from nest returning distance in cm return dist end nestdist innest navigation will be a function of the temperature read by anties thermometer and a light source to exit antie will seek a high temperature until the photoreceptor reaches a threshold of stimulation indicating sunlight and to get deeper antie will seek a lower temperature the code may look something like this exit nest uses temperature gradient to navigate towards the nest entrance from inside void nestexit reads temperature scoots forward 1s reads temperature again takes the difference and determines whether current heading is increasing temperature reading if not rotates 45 degrees and tries again whilephotoip sunrise double temp tempip whiletimer 1 forcruz5 temp tempip iftemp0 rotate45 end nestexit to enter the nest such as at the end of a task antie will perform the same function except it will seek a lower temperature instead of a higher temperature it will avoid light and it will only activate while antie is less than 10cm from the nest entrance this void function will be called nestenter and will take in no inputs to avoid bumping into things including other ants antie be provided with an escape function each of anties eight bump sensors will cause the robot to rotate a different amount and the sonar will cause it to rotate 90 degrees in the opposite direction regardless this will be a very simple function i will include one example escape escapes from danger when bump sensors or sonar are activated void escape declare and initialize left bump sensors in order from front to back bumpleft1 bumpleft2 bumpleft3 bumpleft4 declare and initialize right bump sensors in order from front to back sonar sensors are globally declared ifbumpleft1 reverse at reduced speed forcruz3 and rotate rotate45 end escape because this function responds to the sensors on anties around the sides and only its sonar detectors will be able to detect objects in front of it this escape function will not prevent antie from being able to locate and pick up objects such as seeds before picking objects up however antie will need to identify them this object detection process will be activated when the front bump sensor is stimulated or when both sonar detectors are stimulated chemical inputs will be checked to see what this object is most likely to be given its smell objects will include midden and food the code may look something like this object identification identifies an object that has snuck up on the unsuspecting robot void objid declare and initialize front bump sensor sonar sensors

object has been identified antie may grip it and lift it a simple void function grip taking in no inputs will tighten the grippers until a certain threshold of pressure is reached at which point the grippers will be lifted for carrying a void function release will perform this same action in reverse antie will also need to follow several different kinds of chemical gradient trails it will need to track the trails left by successful patrollers and localize the source of foododors and middenodors implementations of chemical gradient following robots using two sensors on antennae stalks has been successful in with analog robots in the past webb 1998 regardless of the potential problem of airflow causing a disturbed gradient over evaporating pheromones as a partial control for the problem of imprecise sensing a function will perform an analysis of the array information coming on from anties four sensors on each stalk the differences between these outputs is what is being compared everywhere there is a leftip or rightip antie will use the chemical gradient algorithm of braitenbergs aggressive type 2 vehicle described in his book vehicles experiments in synthetic psychology as this was found through a series of experiments by russell et al 2003 to be very efficient when compared to several biomimetic models because the same general algorithm will be followed for the localization of all three chemical traces i will provide pseudocode for only one generic subroutine note that a portion of this subroutine does run on a schema basis follow gradient follows a generic chemical gradient seeking a higher concentration void gradientfollow compares left and right inputs and activates opposite motor to a greater degree if leftip rightip schema rotate90 forcruz5 end schema end if if rightip leftip schema rotate90 forcruz5 end schema end if else forcruz5 end gradientfollow for the purposes of calls later in the pseudocode i will refer to these subroutines as trailfollow findfood and findmidden all three are void and take no inputs the final common subroutine will be one for the identification of other ants when both sonar sensors are stimulated simultaneously antie will check hydrocarbon inputs and determine whether the detected object is a nestmate as harvester ants tend not to engage aggressively with nonnestmates antie will only identify other ants as ants if they belong to its nest research has shown that red harvester ants may identify the tasks nestmates are engaged in based on the ratio of nalkenes to nalkanes in their hydrocarbons and the presence or absence of branched nalkanes the difference in ratio is caused by the time ants spend outside in the sun which depletes their nalkene levels antie will attempt to determine the tasks of other ants by sensing only the nalkene levels the code will be similar to the object identification subroutine and may look something like this ant identification identifies an ant that has snuck up on the unsuspecting robot void antid while leftsonarip rightsonarip are hydrocarbons present is this a nestmate iflefthydrocarbip righthydrocarbip hydrocarbthreshold

nalkene level is appropriate for a midden worker midworkerdetect true if not midden work foraging or patrolling ignore if not nestmate ignore end antid using these basic common behaviors more complex behaviors may be coded red harvester ants do not retain one task throughout their lifespan but instead change their behaviors as is appropriate for the colony gordon 1996 research has shown that red harvester ants switch tasks partially as a function of age ex ingram et al 2005 and partially as a function of interactions with other workers ex schafer et al 2006 gordon 2002 greene gordon 2007 younger ants work more inside the nest and older ants work more outside the nest as a result i will model the three main behaviors in the order that they are to be engaged in midden work which consists of moving dirt between the inside of the nest and the outside will occur first patrolling which involves a shorter overall amount of time spent outside will occur second and foraging will be the final behavior finally i will discuss a main method encoding the task switching between these behaviors the midden work behavior will be anties default initial behavior it will be initiated in the morning by the sunrise and will continue until the outside temperature reaches 52oc at which point all red harvester ants must return to the nest as previously stated a midden worker must identify midden grasp it and carry it to the surface depositing it halfway down the mound before returning to collect more midden a program encoding this behavior might look like this midden work antie will leave nest in the morning after sunrise carrying bits of midden halfway down the nest mound and depositing them antie will return to the nest and repeat this task until the temperature reaches above 52 degrees celsius void midden initiated by sunrise stopped by temperature while photoip sunrise tempip 52 find midden and identify any found objects if they are midden grip and carry outside nest findmidden objid ifmiddendetect grip nestexit cruise to halfway down the nest mound whilenestdistance 25 forcruz release reset middendetect middendetect 0 nestenter end if end while end midden the second behavior patrolling involves two subbehaviors nest patrolling and trail patrolling nest patrolling will involve leaving the nest roaming around on the nest mound for a few minutes and reentering the nest this behavior will be implemented in two parts with a taskswitching algorithm based on age research shows that ants do change their behaviors based partly on their perceived life expectancy moron et al 2007 and that taskswitching is partly genetically controlled by a switch in gene expression as the individual ages ingram et al 2005 it is therefore reasonable to assign a constant age at which antie will switch from nest patrolling to trail patrolling in order to perform both of these functions antie will need a subroutine to explore in a zigzag fashion as harvester ants do gordon 34 harvester ants display a preference to wander in familiar territory though foragers and patrollers do sometimes wander into other nests territories gordon 5760 to control for this behavior anties explore subroutine will display a preference for exploration in places where there is a low gradient of nestmate pheromones this model is reasonable because patrollers and foragers change their explored territory from day to day even though they do retain some more commonly chosen paths gordon 45 the code may look something like this explore takes in desired distance from nest

will only call this behavior for a short distance before returning to the nest to idle for a few minutes and exit again trail patrollers will go much further until food sources are found and will then orient towards the nest and create trails for the foragers to follow a general site of food is all that the patroller need find the foragers will dig through the sand for the food code for the patrolling behavior might look like this note that part is on a schema basis patrolling main patrolling behavior function includes nest patrolling trail patrolling and the stimulation and thresholds to initiate and switch between the two nest patrolling patrollers first job of the day exit the nest and explore the nest mound taking measurements void nestpatrol while photoip light at sunrise

for the taskswitching in the patrolling behavior assume some variable age that antie has been keeping track of using the cpus clock pulses to track the time since its last bootup the integers

nestpatrolage age trailpatrolage nestpatrol while age trailpatrolage age forageage trailpatrol the final behavior foraging will involve one extra subroutine that will employ an algorithm designed by r andrew russell to localize an object through sand based on a chemical plume this will emulate the digging that foragers must often do in order to locate seeds and will enable antie to accurately retrieve seeds for its host nest this algorithm will keep track of the last two intensities of the desired chemical input and compare them it would also keep track of whether the last rotation was clockwise or counterclockwise the code for this adapted from russells paper might look like this hexpath search localizes an object through sand using chemical detection void hexsearch double intense1

address task switching to midden work workers probably switch to patrolling based on their perceived life expectancy and as a function of a gene whose expression changes between young and old ants and this is easily emulated using a clock pulse counter in anties cpu that will count its age since last boot to remind the reader this technique was implemented earlier in this proposal to create the limited taskswitching between nest patrolling and trail patrolling the switch from patrolling to foraging has been modeled as a function of successful foragers returns with great accuracy by schafer et al 2006 and evidence from experiments in which successful foragers were removed before reentry to the nest does support the theory that returning successful foragers have an effect on the activation of new foragers gordon 2002 activated foragers form a queue to exit the nest and exit at a steady rate according to schafers et al model of forager activation every time a successful forager returns and no foragers are currently in line to exit a fraction modeled at 00035 of inactive foragers joins the queue for the purposes of modeling antie i will assume that the switches between these behaviors are permanent irreversible and partly a function of age with new foragers being activated by returning successful foragers the code to model this taskswitching might look

harvester ant colony and providing valuable information not only about the hypothesized rules of these ants behaviors and their taskswitching thresholds but also about the combination of complex behaviors into a single autonomous system with the ability to switch between behaviors as necessary biomimetic robots have long been a rich source of information for both biologists and robotics engineers and complex robots that can switch tasks as the situation demands and communicate information about current tasks could be useful for further studies of complex robot behaviors as well as

 tonal structure and form in bartks concerto for orchestra i drew f nobile university of washington before beginning an analysis of any piece by bla bartk one must first decide to what degree tonal analysis will be used bartks music although it is often difficult to call completely tonal never entirely sheds itself of tonal elements and structure this remains true even with one of his last compositions the concerto for orchestra written two years before his death in 1943 the discussion that follows analyzes the first movement of the concerto focusing on the tonal structures at play throughout the movement the analysis will treat the movement tonally investigating the progression of local tonics and its relationship to the overall form we will also examine to what degree a tonal reading of this movement is limited in its analytical potential in an attempt to pinpoint exactly where bartk strays from commonpractice compositional techniques harmonic structure and form bartk describes the form of the first movement as more or less regular sonata form bartk 431 while that does not seem to be a meaningful assertion it is perfectly accurate the movement is in sonata form but there is an introduction that does not relate thematically to any other parts of the movement not unheard of in mozart sonatas and the recapitulation presents the two themes of the exposition in reverse order the backwards recapitulation is a technique that bartk employs frequently because of the formal symmetry it creates for example the fifth string quartet also see bartks comments on that bartk 414 example 1 shows a diagram of the form of the movement the symmetry is apparent within the seven sections following the introduction as the example shows the development section is divided into three subsections the first and third subsections draw their thematic material from the first theme group and the second subsection involves new material not drawn from the exposition hence on either side of the middle section of the development we have the alternation ftgstgftg which makes the overall form with the exception of the introduction symmetric paul wilson also discusses the inherent symmetry of the movement although his interpretation is somewhat different see wilson 168170 intro ftg stg dev i ftg dev ii new dev iii ftg stg ftg the abbreviations ftg and stg stand for first theme group and second theme group respectively example 1 formal structure of the first movement sonata formor moreorless sonata formcarries harmonic as well as formal connotations while tonality in this piece and in bartks music in general is quite different from its classical interpretation we find that the harmonic structure is at least analogous to the standard sonataform structure to begin with the movement is in f when we say in f we do not imply f major or minor for that matterthe majorminor tonal system in general does not apply to this piecebut rather that the pitchclass f is the tonal center of the movement and acts analogously to the tonic in a mozartian sonata movement using this interpretation we can map out the local tonics tonal centers used throughout the movement as shown in example 2 example 2 harmonic structure of the first movement in this example the barlines divide the formal sections of the piece introductionexpositiondevelopmentrecapitulationso we can immediately see that the tonic f is not established until the exposition begins beginning with the exposition the largescale progression of tonal centers is a wholetone descent from f to f represented by the stemmed notes in example 2 while the introduction ascends from c to f through d shown as d and e in the graph in a quasibass anstieg the middle pitch of the descent b acts as the dominant to f based on its symmetrical division of the wholetone scale and the fact that the second theme appears in b in the exposition bartk has often applied a tonicdominant relationship to a pitchclass and its tritone partner and even admits to using that as a compositional framework in his fifth string quartet see bartk 414415 in this particular movement bartk feigns moving to the tonal dominant c for the second theme before reinterpreting c as a chromatic passing tone between d and bthis and other subtleties shown in example 2 will be explained in detail in later sections paul wilson gives a detailed account of the foreground activity throughout this movement in his analysis we do not seek to duplicate or substitute for his findings our analysis will focus instead on relating the foreground activity to the overarching background structure the graph in example 2 will serve as a point of departure for the subsequent analysis while we will periodically refer back to some of its specific elements it should be understood that even when not explicitly referenced this graph serves as the explanatory goal of this paper the introduction as paul wilson points out the title introduzione given to the movement as a whole seems to apply only to the first 75 measures wilson 172 the introduction does not relate thematically to any of the main sections of the movementin fact it is the third movement that draws its thematic material from this sectionbut the harmonic and motivic principles at play here foreshadow some important elements of the entire piece to begin with the opening motive in the celli and basses shown in example 3 outlines a pentatonic set and strongly presents c as the tonal center the pentatonic set here is exclusively a pitchclass set and its incarnations throughout the movement are devoid of any connotations associated with the pentatonic scale indeed this set can be seen more as a byproduct of stacked perfect fourths than a generative element itself the perfect fourth in fact generates much of the motivic and harmonic material of the entire movement and its importance is immediately evident in the introduction with the opening bass motive furthermore the following two instances of this opening motive shown in examples 4 and 5 remove any doubt as to the motivic importance of the perfect fourth and in turn diminish the importance of the pentatonic set example 3 measures 16 celli and basses example 4 measures 1216 celli and basses example 5 measures 2229 celli basses and violas example 4 transitions from c to f and adds pitchclass e to the pentatonic set of example 3 creating a sixnote set of stacked fourths example 5 shows the true dominance of the perfect fourth the set created is a tennote set derived by stacking fourths if we begin from the final d and ascend the circle of fourths until we reach c we obtain the entire set presented in this example each note is either approached or left or both by a fourth and the structural motion is from f to d the overall motion in the first 29 measures is c to d through f these are represented enharmonically in example 2 as d e and g as previously mentioned this motion constitutes the initial ascent to what will eventually be a wholetone descent from f to f so the prevailing structural motion of the movement as a whole is a descending whole step and the prevailing melodic motion is a usually ascending perfect fourth we can connect the two by noting that the descending whole step consists of two ascending fourths indeed the structural wholetone descent is often filled in with the intervening fourth this motion is exemplified in example 2 in the second theme group mm 155233 and as we will see it occurs in other places though not relevant enough to the background structure to be represented in example 2 each time the motion in examples 3 through 5 breaks from chains of fourths the same sequence of intervals occurs two descending perfect fourths separated by an ascending major second 5 2 5 each instance of this intervallic cell is bracketed in the examples this sequence of intervals is the inversion of those found in the second head motive of the first theme of the exposition shown in measures 23 of example 8 so although there is no thematic relation between the introduction and the main sections of the movement within the first 29 measures we can already see structural harmonic and motivic elements that apply to the movement as a whole the section from measures 3550 is centered on e upon the return of d enharmonically respelled as e in measure 58 we see that e acts as its upperneighbor this relationship is somewhat obscured by measures 5157 however while there is no clear tonal center for this section g appears in the outer voices in measure 51 although the harmonic material is reminiscent of c minor the concluding motive of this section in the violins the bracketed sections of example 6 as well as the bass motive of measure 58ff example 7 are related to the first head motive of the first theme which is shown in the first measure of example 8 all three of these motives span a tritone which as mentioned is the dominant relationship in this movement paul wilson describes the transition from the introduction to the exposition as quite abrupt and seemingly unmotivated wilson 173 but it is in fact this motivic relationship that ties them together and creates a rather smooth transition example 6 measures 5658 violin 1 example 7 measure 58 violas celli basses repeated through measure 75 the exposition although the motivic relationship between the introduction and the first theme of the exposition smooth the transition nearly every other element changes when the first theme appears the drastic tempo and meter changes as well as the first appearances of staccato articulations make it clear to the listener that the introduction is over as mentioned the first theme the beginning of which is reproduced in example 8 contains two head motives the first is the tritonespanning ascent that appears in the first measure and the second is an iteration of the interval cell 5 2 5 that appears in the second through third measures while the presence of the perfect fourths that was so prevalent in the introduction is clear in the latter the former does not employ the perfect fourth in its formation rather this motive is a smallscale representation of the tonicdominant relationship of tritone partners specifically f and b that is the basis for the harmonic structure of this movement example 8 measures 7680 violins rhythmically we have a dissonance between the melody which follows the written meter and the accompanying chords in the bassoons horns and lower strings example 9 reproduces the chords and example 10 rewrites them in a meter that is more consistent with their rhythmic pattern as example 10 shows the chords are moreorless in duple meter 48 and 28 with one hiccup occurring in the 58 measure this is in strict metric dissonance with the triple meter of the melody with its own hiccups occurring in the written 28 measures as we will later see this dissonance disappears when this theme returns in the recapitulation example 9 measures 7791 bassoons horns lower strings reduced example 10 measures 7791 rebarred to reflect rhythmic pattern we have already mentioned that the first theme group is in fthis is made clear from the onset both in the melodic line and by the f minor triad that occurs on the downbeat of measure 77 while the material occasionally departs from this f in measures 7694 these departures are all subordinate to the prolonged f e is the tonal center for measures 95134 although it does not appear as a strong bass note until measure 131 measures 95130 contain a mostly chromatic descent from c to e where e is anticipated throughout as a goal tone for the bass example 11 illustrates this structure immediately following the arrival of e in the bass c d is established as the tonal center for the final transition to the second theme the trombone motive in measures 134141 shown in example 12 is the subject of the fugato section in part 3 of the development although its importance is downplayed here note that the initial g is a pickup to the section in c which fills in the wholetone descent from e to c with the intervening fourth this motive also contains the intervallic cell of the second head motive of the first theme in the form of gcbe with the addition of some passing tones in addition to consisting largely of motion by perfect fourths example 11 bass structure of the first theme group measures 76155 example 12 measures 134141 trombone wilson claims that c and e are local dominants to f in this first section of the exposition wilson 174 while the strong vi motion from measures 9091 does carry a tonal implication of dominanttonic such cadential bass motion does not imply anything about structural function in this context e furthermore is not convincingly established as a dominantfunctioning tone at all the passage from measures 8589 is centered on e and the pentatonic set from the opening of the exposition is transposed down a whole step but its mere presence as local tonic does not signify any sort of dominant function rather we can consider this occurrence of e as a middlegroundlevel wholetone descent that foreshadows the structural descent to e at measure 131 that is represented in example 2 in measures 9195 the bass descends fedc which might seem to support cs functioning as structural dominant however as previously mentioned c acts as a fake dominant that in measures 149155 actually functions as an upper neighbor to b the true dominant the descent in measures 9195 in fact participates in the farce by projecting a descent ending on c which makes the eventual reinterpretation of c and descent to b stronger this creates both a smooth transition to the second theme and a strong sense that a new section is beginning a combination that is generally rather difficult to forge the second theme is tranquil and harmonically simple which is in stark contrast to the first theme b dominates as tonal center from measures 155191 with little or no harmonic motion away from it measures 192197 are in e with the bass notes in the harp and measures 198209 are in d a intervenes between e and d in measure 195another instance of the wholetone being filled in by a fourth the return to b in measure 210 is also filledin in this way by f in measures 208209 hence measures 155210 constitute the bass progression bedb the same stepwise descent ed occurred in the first theme group while f rather than b was being prolonged paul wilson points out that in substituting for f within an analogous structure b receives confirmation at this point as the crucial interior center of the movement wilson 179 in our terminology this is the point at which b is unequivocally established as the structural dominant the development as mentioned the development is divided into three subsections in example 2 the entire development section is represented by exactly three pitches and indeed each subsection is associated with one of these three pitches as its tonal centernone of these pitches is involved in the structural wholetone descent as paul wilson states the development is for bartks music developmental in a relatively conventional way the themes from the exposition are expanded and modified and tonalities other than those expected arise wilson 180 the only slight abnormality though it is certainly not unheard of even in classicalperiod sonata movements is the emergence of a new theme in the second section of the development although wilson claims that this theme is based on a transformation in rhythm and contour of the second headmotive of the firsttheme wilson 182 there is no intervallic relationship between the two motives and it is not clear what elements of a motive remain when rhythm contour and interval content are changed furthermore this section being the middle section of the movement upholds the formal symmetry if interpreted as its own theme the first section of the development measures 231271 begins with a big dminor chord which immediately establishes d as the tonal center for the section although it moves to e minor in measure 239 it returns to d minor in measure 248 which suggests that e is an upper neighbor prolonging d the passage beginning at measure 248 shown in example 13 can be considered to be the theme of this section and is a development of the second head motive of the first theme this motive undergoes inversion and extension throughout the section while wilson rightly identifies the resultant set of measures 261264 as 6z50 014679 identifying it as such does not offer much analytical insight until we point out that this is a simple extension of the intervallic sequence 5 2 5 from the original motive example 13 measures 248264 violins the second section of the development is in c which is sometimes spelled d this section is reproduced as example 14 this section returns to the calm simplicity and tempo of the second section though apart from affect there are no references to that section although the c major chord in measure 293 preceded by a major v in measure 285 suggests c as tonal center the tonality is not strongly established until measure 303 the arrival at c was foreshadowed by the first two measures of the development example 15 which are almost a direct transposition of the two head motives of the first theme to c because of its emphasis here in the development section and its position as leading to b in the second theme group we could conceive of c as a subdominant in this movement as tempting as this interpretation may be this observation is relegated to the notes section because it constitutes a horrible abuse of terminologythere is only so far that such tonal analogies can go before they begin to hide any true analytical insight behind misused terms example 15 measures 231232 violins and trumpets example 14 measures 272313 reduction development part 2 the third section of the development takes the trombone motive from the transition between the first and second sections of the exposition shown in example 12 transposed to begin on f and turns it into a fugato sequence reproduced in example 17 the tonal center b is established immediately in measures 316318 by the strong vi chord progression example 16 as previously mentioned the fugato motive incorporates the motion by perfect fourths found in the introduction as well as the intervallic cell found in the second head motive of the first theme the resultant set is the pentatonic set fbead the entire passage shown in example 17 remains within this set the second and fourth entrances of the fugato subject are transposed up a perfect fifth but the first note is b rather than c which allows bartk to remain in this pentatonic set and also to reinforce b as tonal center example 16 measures 316318 establishment of b the second instance of the fugato section not reproduced in its entirety but based on the subject in example 18 is an exact pitch inversion transposed to begin on c the inversion blends seamlessly back into the original subject in measure 363 the following section measures 363389 especially brings out the quartal harmonies within the pentatonic set so much so that b is obscured as tonal center which allows a to emerge as the goal tone of this sectiononly to be immediately reinterpreted as a leading tone to the a that begins the recapitulation both b and a are chromatic neighbors to a which intensifies the arrival on a and brings out the fact that the appearance of a continues the largescale wholetone descent that has been left stranded on b for the entire development section example 17 measures 316340 brass fugato section example 18 measures 342349 horns inverted fugato subject the recapitulation the recapitulation as we have seen presents the themes in reverse order the second theme is initially presented in a as part of the wholetone descent and proceeds directly to g where it is restated slightly modified it is worth pointing out that the arrival on g at measure 425 is led into by d which constitutes another filling in of the wholestep by the intervening fourth the a in measure 438 might initially seem to be a new tonal area but it leads to d in measure 444 which constitutes a v chord still applied to g rather than resolve this d back to g however bartk shifts briefly to f in measure 456 and leads to e in measure 467 e and f are both active throughout the entire transition from second theme back to first theme measures 456487 which brings out their functions as upper and lower chromatic neighbors to f which returns triumphantly in measure 488 with the muchanticipated recapitulation of the first theme the return of the first theme is certainly immediately recognized as such however there are some important differences firstly its initial appearance in the exposition had a minor flare to it the first chord in example 9 is an fminor triad and the first four notes of example 8 ascend the fminor scale in the recapitulation of this theme shown in example 19 the first chord is an fmajor chord and the a is replaced by a in the melody in fact the chord progression of the first four measures of example 19 can be thought of tonally as iviv in f majorwhile we are reluctant to say that this passage is in major the conspicuous a in measure 490 easily brings doubt to this interpretation we can certainly say that the minor flare of the beginning has been replaced by a major flare here in the recapitulation in addition to the modeshift we notice that the metric dissonance shown in examples 9 and 10 no longer appears notice how regular the rhythm of the accompanying figure is in example 19 and also that the written meter no longer changes in other words the piece in becoming more regular is beginning to drive towards the finishbecause of the formal structure the recapitulation of the first theme also serves as the closing section of the movement indeed this section has the feel of a coda to itit is much shorter than any other major section or subsection and the tonic harmony is active throughout there are also no phrase divisionsthe music simply drives forward with no pause until measure 514 where the fugato motive appears in the brass over an obvious vi cadence signaling the end of the movement which occurs as the motive completes example 19 measures 488494 the first theme in the recapitulation there is no fine line between music that is tonal and music that is atonal bartk is one of the many earlytwentieth century composers whose music fits entirely in the gray area between tonality and atonality while we know from his writings that he often composed with a tonal centers and relationships in mind and that he regularly applied tonal structures and forms to his compositions by merely glancing at any one of his pieces we can see that tonality as it is understood in the common practice period is not at work thanks largely to the work of tonal theorists such as heinrich schenker and others we have a detailed system for analyzing tonal musictheir system however is virtually useless in analyzing music that falls entirely on the atonal side of the spectrum but if we apply it to music such as bartks that is in the middle area we can come up with some enlightening and perhaps unexpected results to do so was the goal of this analysis of the first movement of the concerto for orchestra by applying our tonal system to music that slips outside of the tonal realm we not only find the elements of tonality that do remain but we also pinpoint exactly when and how this music breaks from previous conventions it is not disputed that bartks music has great expressive powerperhaps now we can understand why references antokoletz elliot the music of bla bartk a study of tonality and progression in twentiethcentury music berkeley

 lauren ballinger 051208 reaching transcendence through the elimination of color the ideal minimalism of black and white the world is made up of a myriad of colors color gives distinction to our life it gives flavor and meaning what would our lives be without color at the same time in our modern society color has been seen as an external threat to be purged from the enlightened mind and space color is seen as corrupting intoxicating disorienting and in art has come to be associated with the vulgar and the kitsch we went from times of celebrating color and decoration to one of minimalism where black and white were placed at the front as representations of modernity and ultimate transcendence what is the significance for this preference for black and white when it comes to high art why in a world filled with color do we feel the need to purge it from our space what exactly is the debate between colorlessness vs color and more specifically can black and white be considered noncolors ever since the dawn of man human society has evolved in ways which attempt to ultimately control nature seeing as color is something of the natural world age old and archaic washing it away from our lives is the ultimate form of rising above the physical world intelligent beings have a language represented by articulate sounds organized beings like all animals and vegetables express themselves by cries or forms contour or carriage inorganic nature has only the language of color it is by color alone that a certain stone tells us it is a sapphire or emerald color then is the peculiar characteristic of the lower forms of nature while drawing becomes the medium of expression more and more dominant the higher we rise in the scale of beingblanc chromophobia p25 the history of color is about the ways in which man has tried to find the ideal state of being throughout the ages in the far east reaching a state of colorlessness is associated with the highest state of spiritual being the state of zen what is typical of this sort of ascetism is the art of expressing as much as possible using the minimum as an ideal this is apparent through japanese haiku as well as the art of ink painting in both china and japan for them reaching the greatest depths of spirituality demanded expression in its most minimal form this reduction of color and expression proved the purity the artist had reached within himself it was a means of reducing down to the essence of a thing in the elimination of color in the far east izutsu explains though how this ultimate state of minimalism can only be reached through an appreciation and fine knowledge of color this artistic acestism ie the suppression of externals and the reduction of all colors to black and white manifests its real aesthetic function only against the background of a highly refined sensibility for colors and their subtle hues in other words the true profundity of the beauty of black and white is disclosed only to those eyes that are able to appreciate the splendors of sumptuous and glowing colors with all their delicate shades and tintsizutsu p 169 for black and white can only be seen as distinguishing against a background of color and for this very reason one can assert that both black and white are colors in themselves as noncolors it is through the absence of color that one brings to mind the colors that are no longer present it is up to the mind to fill in the blank space without color one could not appreciate the purity of the black and white space colorlessness needs color in order to for the full aesthetic experience to take place that is to say under the total absence of color there is a vague reminiscence of all colors that have been killedizutsu p 177 black and white are the consummation of all colors into one black is life it is the infinite possibility of expression and development black here is not sheer black for in its negation of all colors all colors are positively affirmedizutsu p 193 it is through these means that one finds the essence in a thing in western society this purging of color began with the rejection of ideals of generations past eliminating color was a way of eliminating the decadence of the 18th century society turned to minimalism as a way of cleansing life representing modernity color became a moral issue seen as something sensuous and dangerous in its secondary nature to the essence of life and form the predominance of color at the expense of drawing is a usurpation of the relative over the absolute of fleeting appearance over permanent form of physical impression over the empire of the soulchromophobia p 28 color rests on the surface of an object it is superficial cosmetic and therefore deceptive since it hides the true nature of that thing color is associated with the fall from grace it is something which speaks to the senses not the mind it is external and therefore secondary to life it deals with the body emotions not the intellect it strays from reason in the way which it consumes and manipulates life color was a permanent internal threat an everpresent inner other which if unleashed would be the ruin of everything the fall of culture for charles blanc color also represents a kind of ruination color for him signifies the mythical savage state out of which civilization the nobility of the human spirit slowly heroically has lifted itself but back into which it could always slidechromophobia p 23 it is a descent in the way it makes one lose consciousness and enter into the physical world of desire and to desire is to lose control over oneself thus began the cult of the black and white white is seen as representing spirituality the heavens and light it is all which is modern it signifies the opposite of the carnal nature of color it is the control of nature and the body and represents the modern man white is the spiritual color of our times the clearness which directs all out actions it is neither grey white nor vory white but pure white white is the color of modern times the color which dissipates a whole era our era is perfection purity certitude white it includes everything we have superceded both the brown of decadence and classiscm and the blue of divisionism the cult of the blue ky the gods with green beards and the spectrum white pure whitechromophobia p 47 for these reasons black and white have been placed at the top of the hierarchy of colors abolishing color means controlling color the white surface exposes color presents it for disciplining it keeps an eye on all the objects it frames but before that it keeps an eye on itself watching its freshly laundered and neatly folded fabric for the stain of colorwigly p 151 colorlessness is not natural and thus proves mans superiority over this world on the other hand we need color in order to distinguish black and white just as those from the far east the purity of white implies what has been washed away and thus makes the white glitter even more white and black stand out because of color and color stand out because of white and black they are linked intrinsically together one cannot go without the other white is the setting for color in a mosque for example the architectonic effect of its white garment is assisted by a strategic use of color all these things are clothed in a majestic coat of whitewash the forms stand out clearly the impeccable construction displays all its boldness at times a high stylobate of delightful ceramic produces a blue vibration the sensuous vibration of the color clarifies the white surface whose limit it markswigley p 209 we need this opposition between color and noncolor to make distinction between the two otherwise neither would hold such significance white helps to harmonize colors that would otherwise clash it brings together and unites white expresses a certain incorporeality the use of white is therefore decisive for the bodily appearance of a space concrete bodies decrease the space more or less depending on their color value against white one can actually establish the intensity of clashing colors white determines the tone in the first place because of this it is possible to take up any given colors and make them harmonizewigley p 311 for this reason white walls are favored over colored ones for both galleries and architectural spaces the white of the walls intensifies the color of what is set before them it stabilizes and controls forms because it brings to light the contours of the space in the white painted room the clarity of spatial sensation and disposition was surest and most convincing all the details of the form and color of the furnishings could be developed undisturbed in front of this backgroundin this a form was discovered which was completely convincing in its simplicity and which could be seen as one of the essential formulas for wall treatment in closed spaceswigley p 313 there is another important aspect which white is representative of and that is the well educated and socially elite in the 19th century it became fashionable for bourgeois women to dress in white while men dressed in black wigley these distinctions proved a certain rational order only attained by those able to afford of it white walls white clothing they both require much more maintenance than something colored where a stain can merely hide away among the other colors crisp whiteness on the other hand expresses a sort of luxury and leisure white clothing proved that someone was of a level of society in which they were not forced to work for the clothing would immediately become soiled if not and thus the reason why women who were the ones to stay at home dressed in all white while men who were the ones to go out and work wore black for black did in fact hide stains the same goes with white walls in their impeccability it proved to whoever that the owner could afford to not live actually live in this space or could afford more simply for the upkeep and constant fresh coats of paint both as well were signs of the modern age man had reached pure white was de rigueur partly because of its exciting novelty partly because it emphasized the smoothly mechanical texture and pointed the contrast between it and surrounding naturewigley p xvii the use of white was proof that man had conquered nature the use of white and black in dress and architecture also became a way of distinguishing oneself from the vulgar normal lower classes it is also worthy of remark that savage nations uneducated people and children have a great predilection for vivid colors that animals are excited to rage by certain colors that people of refinement avoid vivid colors in their dress and the objects that are about them and seem inclined to banish them altogether from their presencechromophobia p 112 furthermore with the advent of industrialization the invention of new synthetic dyes meant that color in dress became democratized for all classes now anyone could afford to wear colorful clothing and the masses began to dress themselves in what once would have been inconceivable to them thus said the use of black in white in wardrobe perhaps was a way for the new bourgeoisie to distinguish themselves from the decadence of the upper class and the vulgarity from the low in the prevailing styles of the european bourgeoisie there long survived a tendency to limit the use of color with strong emphasis on what are generally thought of as non colors such as white black and graythe style engine p 40 another reason why it is believed that the bourgeoisie took preference in black and white is because of the victorian sobriety of the age and their obsession with purity and cleanliness wearing black and white also marked the distinction of labor between men and women and in a highly rigid and segmented society the wearing of different colors seemed the most obvious way to do so this simplicity of dress was seen as a mark of the modern man other major technologies during the age of industrialization also had an effect on this preference for black and white photography took over as a means of portraiture for the bourgeois and the upper class and despite the fact that it was possible to color the photographs for the most part they were left in black and white because it was seen as more natural above all it is believed that the expanse of literacy and the printed word mainly the newspaper had a profound effect in influencing the choice of black and white this world was viewed as orderly and relatively uniform a world in black and white this led to the idea of writing rationality production that confined images especially images in color to the emerging field of art which was understood as an essential activity but one that was essentially unproductive while it assigned to the twotoned and orderly world of printed paper the role of a daily guide to existencethe style engine p 42 the world of print was therefore seen as something serious for the modern man black and white became a symbol for the superiority of mans intellect and technology this then translated down into the world of fashion as seen with the distinction between black and white clothing as well as art namely photography but also film and as discussed before architecture and gallery space seeing as since the time of aristotle form was valued over that of color the arts which did not require color to be enjoyed were perceived to be that of a higher form the explosion of mass production and printing allowed for a plethora of colorful advertising and consumer goods which came to be known as kitsch kitsch is a product of the industrial revolution which urbanized the masses of western europe and america and established what is called universal literacygreenberg in order to meet the demand of mass markets cheap and bright things of little use were made to attract the attention of consumers kitsch made cheap what once was truly cultural by the way it reproduced it d infinitum greenberg continues by saying kitsch using for raw material the debased and academicized simulacra of genuine culture welcomes and cultivates this insensibility it is the source of its profits kitsch is mechanical and operates by formulas kitsch is vicarious experience and faked sensations kitsch changes according to style but remains always the same kitsch is the epitome of all that is spurious in the life of our times kitsch pretends to demand nothing of its customers except their money not even their time with the advent of kitsch came a great need for the distinction between higher and lower artforms avant guard at the time was considered to be true art while this kitsch was simply pure imitation thus said this along with the influence of black and white print perhaps was the cause for the belief that which was black and white was deemed a serious high art while that which was colorful was mere rubbish and imitation for the lower classes of course during the early stages of color film and photography the quality was so poor that it gave a cheap look whereas black and white film really allowed one to see the light and the shadows in the images for the play of light and form was key in demonstrating the true art form that was what made up the essence of an image not the artificial or superficial filling in of form with color color was thought to distract the viewer from the soul of the image these beliefs have changed since color technology as tweeked to the point of being almost better than reality still though black and white is seen as something of a more sober tradition photographers still use black and white and white is still the most widely used color for walls within gallery spaces these non colors allow for the appreciation of color when something is black and white it allows the mind to fill in and imagine for itself the amazing colors that must exist beyond the screen many actually complained with the invention of color in movies that this stunted the mind since one was forced to look at the garish colors placed before them it is for this reason that ultimately the use of black and white is seen as more of an intellectual process it forces one to imagine it forces one to delve into the core of the object whether it mean going beyond the mind or simply the purity of non color the use of black and white has been debated over for the last hundred years now we have entered an era where we are seeing once again more color but perhaps it is human instinct to want to surpass and rebel against generations before so possibly we shall return to a state of non color veneration thus is the ebb and flow of life 
 the debate over homosexuality has been one of the most longlasting and controversial ones ever what exactly causes homosexuality some would say it is a gene passed on from parents to child others would argue that it is a result of a childs upbringing still more would claim that it is a mental illness that can and should be cured perhaps then it is a combination of some of these no one knows for sure and it is possible no one ever will but that surely does not stop everyone from coming up with their own theories and beliefs on the matter documented homosexuality dates as far back as ancient greece and other cultures of the time where it was considered to be a very normal and natural occurrence emond in his book the symposium plato wrote those who are halves of a man whole pursue males and being slices so to speak of the male love men throughout their boyhood and take pleasure in physical contact with men qtd in isay 11 this shows that not only did plato consider it normal for a male to be attracted to another male he also believed that it began at a very young age as the word boyhood signifies in fact plato even considered love between two members of the same sex to be the only real and lasting love and necessary for democracy furthermore there were many occurrences of homosexual behavior in greek mythology hercules is rumored to have had 14 male lovers and zeus himself partook in such behavior even homer wrote about achilles and patroclus who have been considered to be the perfect model of true love emond but it was not until 1869 that the term homosexual was first used to describe a man or woman whose feelings of sexual attraction are for someone of the same sex marcus 1 however for the purposes of this paper homosexuality will be looked at solely in terms of men at this point in time karl maria kertbeny used the word in a pamphlet which fought to repeal the current antihomosexual laws of prussia kertbeny derived this word from the greek word for same and the latin word for sex whereas a heterosexual is a person whose feelings of sexual attraction are for the opposite sex marcus 1 it was also in the 1800s when the debate itself over the cause of homosexuality was started by magnus hirschfeld a physician sex researcher leading sexologist homosexual and founder of the first gay rights movement in germany who believed that homosexuality was biological in nature marcus 10 hirschfeld also founded the scientific humanitarian committee which was mostly homosexual in 1897 the committee published many books and other forms of literature which gave hirschfeld a great amount of prestige in his field he became known as one of the founding fathers of sexology and furthered this position when he opened the worlds first sexological institute the institute for sexual science in berlin in 1919 which was destroyed by the nazis 15 years later hirschfeld largely supported the urning theory of karl ulrichs with minor additions he believed in some hormonal theories as a cause of homosexuality but this only led to unsuccessful attempts to cure homosexuals with the use of hormone injections this theory which defined urnings as males who turned to other males as sexual partners was published in twelve pamphlets by ulrichs starting in1864 the first vindex defended urnings while the second inclusa which followed shortly after described the first scientific theory of homoerotic desire ulrichs believed that urnings were attracted to other males because they were hermaphrodites of the mind meaning while they may have been male in body they were female in soul and mind leading them to be naturally attracted to males in terms of sexual partners this he claimed made laws such as paragraph 175 a law adopted by king william i throughout the german kingdoms at the time of their unification which forbade sex between males and forced criminal penalties upon individuals partaking in such behavior unfair and unreasonable ulrichs claimed that the origin of such a disposition was natural and inborn wikholm a couple thousand years after plato and homer sigmund freud still believed homosexuality to be a natural behavior in an interview in 1903 he professed his beliefs i am of the firm conviction that homosexuals must not be treated as sick people homosexual persons are not sick they also do not belong in a court of law qtd in isay 3 in 1935 he furthered his claims when he wrote a now famous letter to an american mother of a homosexual which stated that homosexuality is assuredly no advantage but is nothing to be ashamed of no vice no degradation it cannot be classified as an illness many highly respectable individuals of ancient and modern times have been homosexuals qtd in isay 3 however the general public of the 1800s and early 1900s including the medical professionals regarded homosexuality as a curable mental illness treatments such as castration hysterectomy lobotomy and electroshock therapy were used as attempted cures by the mid 1900s psychotherapy became the most common cure and many homosexuals spent countless hours being analyzed in hopes of changing their sexual preference dudley 125 dr evelyn hooker a heterosexual psychologist conducted a groundbreaking study in the mid 1950s that went along similar reasoning as freud in this courageous experiment hooker compared the psychological profiles of sixty men half homosexual and half heterosexual she disagreed with the popular belief at the time that homosexuality was a mental illness and concluded that there was no significant psychological difference between homosexual and heterosexual men gay men were no more insane than their straight counterparts marcus 183 fortunately many prominent psychiatrists also believed that homosexuality was not an illness and their lobbying along with the innovative study performed by hooker who has been referred to as the rosa parks of the gay movement convinced the american psychiatric association board of trustees to vote to remove homosexuality from the diagnostic and statistical manual as a mental illness in december of 1973 just over a year later the american psychological association also removed homosexuality from their list of mental illnesses marcus 11 the american psychological association further reiterated this belief when an overwhelming majority of the council of representatives adopted the resolution on appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation in 1997 which publicly chastised those who attempted to cure homosexuality by means of various forms of treatment it stated rather that homosexuality was merely a difference in the opinion and values of the common person but must still be respected as an individual orientation and thus treated as one resolution on appropriate therapeutic responses to sexual orientation perhaps one of the most famous studies on this topic was concluded in 1991 by michael bailey an assistant professor of psychology at northwestern university and richard pillard an associate professor of psychiatry at boston university school of medicine and found that sexual orientation in males is largely due to genetics for two years these men studied the number of occurrences of homosexuality in both monozygotic or identical twins a set of twins coming from the same fertilized egg and thus having identical dna and dizygotic or fraternal twins a set of twins from too separate zygotes causing them to have similar dna but not any more so than that of two ordinary siblings in addition to adoptive brothers of gay males meaning that all of these males would have been raised in the same environment in total 110 pairs of twins identical and fraternal and 142 sets of male and their adopted brothers were studied where at least one of the two had been classified as homosexual either by selfidentification or other means out of the 56 homosexual males who had identical twins 29 or approximately 52 of their identical twin brothers were also found to be homosexual as compared to only 12 or approximately 22 of the 54 nonidentical twins of homosexual males and 6 or approximately 11 of the 57 adopted brothers of homosexual males who were unrelated in terms of genetics strangely enough the study also included pairs of biological brothers that were not twins and out of the 142 homosexual males studied only 14 or about 9 had homosexual brothers which is approximately the normal statistical incidence of homosexuality in the general population bailey pillard more and more people are beginning to believe that homosexuality is not a choice but rather a feeling that one is born with as one grows older they become aware of sexual feelings towards other persons the only difference between homosexuals and heterosexuals is that while heterosexuals are attracted to members of the opposite sex homosexuals are attracted to those of the same sex therefore neither homosexuals nor heterosexuals really have a choice in the matter and asking a homosexual why are you attracted to other members of your sex is likened to asking a heterosexual why are you attracted to members of the opposite sex after all why would anyone choose such a difficult lifestyle as a homosexual one risks horrifying their parents other family members and friends to the point of losing all contact with them ruining their career being condemned by their religion being beat up for publicly displaying their sexuality and much much more rather the only actual choice is whether or not to be open with ones sexuality and sexual preference whether to act on ones sexual desires whether to tell others about such feelings or whether to live a whole life as a lie and suppress these attractions marcus 9 to supplement my findings from research i have conducted personal interviews with two adolescent homosexual males james dobbens and daniel woods both were asked how what they thought determined homosexuality nature vs nurture and why when they realized they were homosexual and how they knew and similar questions both believed that homosexual was a result of nature rather than nurture dobbens woods dobbens reasoned that most parents would not raise their children to be homosexual theyre not like my childs going to be gay dobbens dobbens believes that he was born homosexual when why he was a homosexual he explained its just the way you are you cant explain it i was just born that way its like asking how the world was made no one really knows dobbens he went on to explain that while his nurture did not impact his sexual orientation it did affect his view of it when discussing the role of parents and upbringing in a childs sexuality he commented they can bring you up to be open minded to homosexuality but they dont bring you up to be a homosexual i grew up in a place where homosexuality is accepted so thats why im so open about being gay i accept myself whether or not you accept homosexuality and can be honest with yourself if you are homosexual depends on how youre brought up dobbens woods generally agreed with dobbens and justified his belief that homosexuality was caused by ones nature rather than nurture when he commented that theres nothing in my upbringing that exposed me to anything like homosexuality woods when asked why he was gay he explained that it is simply something that i cant help embedded in my head nothing made me do it woods he went on to explain that it the same thing as the primitive attraction between males and females only it was between males and other males he added that nothing happened to make me homosexual its always been there ive always been attracted to guys woods what i find to be extraordinary about woods case is that he remarked how while he has always been sexually attracted go guys he is romantically attracted to women in the sense that he has always wanted a girlfriend and to be close with other females etc but never in a sexual sense though he has always kind of fantasized about getting married to a female these feelings come from his romantic side which is different from the sexual side woods he says that if he married a female with which he shared a strong trust maybe he could work it out he then went back to talk about homosexuality as in innate characteristic its like race its all something you cant help it all comes to you its internal you cant help it woods when asked if he thought homosexuality was caused by a gene he commented that he thought that it was more of an instinct he gave the example of birds which are born with instincts such as knowing how to build a next or catch their prey woods also thought that maybe it was caused by something in the development of the embryo all in all woods views homosexuality as fascinating his final thought i also believe everyone has at least one homosexual attraction its not black and white homosexual vs heterosexual its a spectrum woods yet there are arguments against homosexuality as caused by genetics according to darwins theory of natural selection the advantageous traits are passed on while the disadvantageous ones eventually die out for instance heterosexual males have an average of five times as many children as homosexual ones as a female is required to reproduce children yet homosexuals are by definition not sexually attracted to females therefore from the evolutionary standpoint homosexuality becomes one of the disadvantageous traits because consequently heterosexual men contribute five times as much genetic information to the next the gene pool if homosexuality was indeed caused by a gene it would have died out entirely by now or at least been reduced immensely in the number of occurrences since neither of these events have yet taken place it can be concluded that homosexuality is not caused by a gene fulkerson my findings throughout my research have led me to conclude that there is no definitive answer on what causes homosexuality no one knows for sure now although many think they do and perhaps no one ever will know the whole truth nonetheless i am apt to believe that homosexuality is the product of some kind of combination of genetic and environmental causes perhaps one may have a genetic predisposition towards homosexuality that has been passed on from previous generations however this does not necessarily determine a homosexual rather this predisposition must be triggered by environmental factors this is why bailey and pillard found in their study that while they was a greatly elevated chance that two males sharing the same genetic makeup would also share the same sexuality this was not the case 100 of the time this seems to be the most likely explanation as of now but even as i write this new studies are being done perhaps the truth is right around the corner works cited apa online 2003 american psychological association httpwwwapaorg bailey j m and r c pillard a genetic study of male sexual

 amanda bates november 11 2008 madame white snake east asian femme fatale of old the chinese legend of madame white snake the snake demon that takes human form and becomes the wife of a man has exerted a lasting influence over east asian folktales and fiction for centuries two quintessential novellas the lust of the white serpant from ugetsu monogatari by the japanese author ueda akinari and eternal prisoner under thunder peak pagoda a traditional chinese story are both relatively complex and demonstrate not only the evolution of the white snake figure to become a more believable human but also what aspects may have given her enduring appeal while both these stories are ostensibly morality tales about the dangerous beauty of this femme fatale the true source of pleasure from these narratives is the femme fatales transgressive behavior not her eventual punishment for it early tales of madame white snake appeared in china as early as the song dynasty and initially her portrayal was fairly direct as a villainous demon who drains the life force out of her human husband lai whalen from folklore to literate theater unpacking madame white snake asian folklore studies 51 no 1 1992 52 but over time characterizations of her became more complex and the persona of madame white snake became more sympathetic and perhaps even a model of the ideal confucian wife particularly in pagoda whalen lai notes she was a loving wife a caring mother rescuer of her family from the first flood and at that point a general benefactor of man she took on the virtues of a traditional chinese female particularly forbearance ibid 53 but if she were really an ideal wife why could she not live happily with her human mate her dangerous sexuality is the key femme fatale might seem an unusual term to apply to a character from premodern chinese and japanese literature who may exemplify the virtues of an ideal confucian wife since it is primarily associated with film characters particularly those of the film noir genre but this term which is relatively speaking a neologism the earliest uses were around the beginning of the 20th century oxford english dictionary femme oxford university press httpdictionaryoedcomcgientry5008354150083541se3single1querytypewordquerywordfemmefatalefirst1maxtoshow10hilite50083541se3 is an apt description of the depiction of madame white snake and all her incarnations it refers to a woman who is dangerously attractive and lures men to their downfall with her sexual attractiveness in both incarnations of madame white snake the authors depict her as bewitchingly beautiful toyoo her human lover in lust of the white serpant cannot shake the image of her beauty from his mind and dreams of her and finds himself disturbed and agitated by her ethereal

doing business eternal prisoner under the thunder peak pagoda trans diana yu in y w ma and joseph s m lau traditional chinese stories themes and variations boston zheng zui co 1986 358 both of these stories align negative connotations with her beauty suggesting that her sexuality is the cause of their distraction in addition to distracting sexuality the irregular characterization of madame white snake might be another trait her character has in common with the archetypical noir femme fatale in her essay analyzing the noir film from a feminist perspective christine gledhill writes not only is the hero frequently not sure whether the woman is honest or a deceiver but the heroines characterisation is itself fractured so that it is not evident to the audience whether she fills the femme fatale stereotype or not christine gledhill klute 1 a contemporary film noir and feminist criticism in feminism and film ed e ann kaplan new york oxford university press 2004 81 while both stories each characterize madame white snake fairly consistently within their narratives the uneven characterization in film noir perhaps mirrors the evolution of her character over time readers may not be sure whether she is a pure villainess or whether she is a good wife who is badly treated by society because there is evidence of both throughout her legend she is a loyal wife to her husband as she has promised but she also causes him to find trouble with the law and deceives him about her supernatural nature the complications in her character serve to undercut the ostensible didactic intent of these stories a simple reading of the story might produce the idea that madame white snake represents dangerous female aggression and sexuality that traps the man and she must be defeated and punished by society this is quite similar to the expected end for the femme fatal character in films she is punished in some way so that social order and proper gender roles are restored in both stories madame white snakes secret is uncovered and a monk comes to exorcise her and she is eventually rendered powerless and trapped under a pagoda her husband becomes a monk and this further implicates lady white snake this time from a buddhist perspective female beauty is a dangerous thing that ties men to the transitory world and prohibits them from being free from desire and ascending to nirvana furthermore lady white snakes lover is far from the ideal man he is weakwilled and not particularly useful in lust the priest informs toyoo those creatures took advantage of your fair looks and tempted you but you yourself owing to a lack of courage and spirit fell victim to their temporary form ugetsu monogatari 177178 the implications of this are that a stronger more capable man would not fall for the ladys trickery but are the morals of these stories entirely sincere if they were madame white snake would be unmistakably depicted as an evil character instead both these stories feature many moments where readers have great sympathy for her despite her depraved sexuality certainly readers admire her patience and loyalty i searched everywhere and now that at last ive found you im very happy ibid173 she gushes to him in lust readers must also acknowledge that her human lover is breaking his promise to her when he leaves her she pleads with him we have a love bond between us as constant as the tai mountains and the eastern sea and we must live and die together please since we are already married take me back and lets stay together the rest of our lives wouldnt that be wonderful eternal prisoner 369 in another traditional vernacular story tsu shihniang sinks the jewel box in anger tu shihniang sinks the jew box in anger trans richard m w ho in y w ma and joseph s m lau traditional chinese stories themes and variations boston zheng zui co 1986 358 the male protagonist breaks a promise he made to his concubine lover and suffers for it suggesting that traditionally loyalty and keeping ones word was valued on the mans part as well as a womans so her husbands failure to follow through on his end of the bargain completely forgetting the love he once had for her makes readers more sympathetic to madame white snakes plight however no matter how much sympathy madame white snake may gather from readers the story still ends with her trapped under the pagoda these stories draw from the long tradition of supernatural and ghost stories which usually end with the demon destroyed or at least subdued in the initial versions of this story madame white snake harmed her human lover so her entrapment under a pagoda by a taoist monk or later a buddhist monk lai 53 would have been a satisfying ending readers of early versions of the story might have been cheering for the defeat of this demon disguised as a beauty and would have enjoyed reading the stories for the lurid horror details and later her crushing defeat conversely the authors of the two stories examined here do not give readers motivation to wish for the death of madame white snake so the pleasure of the narrative to borrow appropriate phrasing from film theory comes not from the death of the insubordinate disruptive force from watching the transgressions themselves in an essay on the femme fatale heroines of film noir janey place argues that the strong behavior of the female characters supersedes the moral lessons supposedly imparted by their morals at the end she writes the final lesson of the myth often fades into the background and we retain the image of the erotic strong unrepressed if destructive woman janey place women in film noir in women in film noir ed e ann kaplan london british film institute 2003 48 in these two stories the femme fatale madame white snake is going to live on in the minds of readers not as the shrunken snake trapped under a pagoda but the sexy aggressive woman who took a weaker human man as her lover this resistant reading of the text may be too colored by modern viewpoints since it is impossible to know for certain what readers in the past enjoyed about these stories however consciously or unconsciously these authors created a female character who fits the characteristics of a feisty heroine in fact communists in the prc in the 1970s reclaimed her as a feminist symbol for women who rebel against the patriarchy lai 52 just as the dangerous femme fatale of noir films has reemerged as a heroine in her own right rather than the sexy death trap for the male protagonist so too lady white snake should be reclaimed for her sexual assertiveness and life slightly outside the bounds of conventional social expectations 
 the decline of the northeastern ohio steel market why did attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail an extended essay in history by philosophy e walker candidate number xxxxxxxxx supervisor alexis mamaux date january 12 2004 word count 3215 united world college of the american west montezuma nm 87731 usa september 19 1977 is a date that few people in youngstown ohio will ever forget on that date jennings lambeth president of youngstown sheet and tube company announced that most of the steel companys campbell works would close although for other cities this would simply be a minor economic setback for the people of youngstown and the surrounding area it meant disaster mahoning county was a oneindustry area and the people of youngstown struthers campbell boardman township and the numerous other small towns and villages in the area only had one main employer the steel mills the events that would follow this date known as black monday are seen by the people who witnessed them either as stories of great courage and determination or as monuments to human failure and false hope rather than sit back and wait for their jobs to be snatched away the workers and local union members in the mills fought long and hard to be able to keep the factories open petitions protests rallies collectivization and even the takeover of a steel companys headquarters were all attempted in a desperate movement by those in the industry to preserve the only source of employment that this town had these wellintentioned efforts ultimately failed leaving thousands with shattered dreams and a distinct lack of trust in fellow humankind but why did the brave attempts by union leaders and concerned citizens to revive the steel industry ultimately fail when examining the areas history culture and economic situation we can identify four main reasons the refusal of the international leadership of united steelworkers of america to support their unions youngstown branch the lagging international steel market the lack of a clear organized vision for individual initiatives such as the save our valley campaign and crippling regionalism which caused animosity between different small towns in the region all contributed in some way to the failure of the workers and union leaders to save the industry most importantly the problem in youngstown was a nationwide problem although it affected youngstown and the surrounding area more than it affected other regions the local people simply could not solve a national crisis on a local level a brief history of steel in northeastern ohio in 1802 james and daniel heaton discovered ore and coal lining yellow creek in an area outside of youngstown known as poland township their blast furnace hopewell was the very first blast furnace in the area during the civil war youngstown played a vital role in supplying the union army with iron products youngstown also was a major railway crossroads due to its strategic position between cleveland pittsburgh new york and chicago in fact more rail cars passed under the center street bridge a major bridge in youngstown per day than any other location in the country during the 19th century the center of iron manufacturing had gradually shifted from the far east coast massachusetts and eastern pennsylvania to the ohio valley pittsburgh regions of the northeast including the mahoning valley and the hanging rock region of ohio and kentucky by 1880 youngstowns population had grown to nearly 16000 which meant it had doubled in size over a twentyyear period the town continued to prosper driven by the flux of immigrants pouring in with the hopes of employment at the mills this prosperity continued until the late 1920s when the great depression hit the area hard despite the congress of industrial organizations successful efforts to establish a national steel workers union the industry barely survived the depression years finally the outbreak of the second world war made iron and steel important again and youngstown was bolstered out of its economic standstill into a fastpaced period of booming growth youngstown may have been an important and prosperous region in the postwar period but the seeds for its downfall were slowly being sown strikes racked the town during the forties fifties and sixties and they were often long and bloody in 1973 the experimental negotiating agreement was signed this prohibited strikes and lockout angering workers and driving productivity and laborer morale down at the same time stricter governmental standards for environmental protection and the growth of imported steel were making it harder to produce and market american steel parts and the overeager shareholders in the companies stock were pushing for more and more of their share of the pie most importantly youngstowns steel mills were slowly becoming less efficient and more expensive old technology was not replaced obsolete methods were not updated and almost none of the industrys profits were being utilized to help modernize it was a recipe for disaster that would soon explode in the faces of hundreds of thousands of workers and their families black monday and the crash of the steel industry the announcement of the closing of the mills in 1977 was the beginning of a downward spiral which would send the entire valley into chaos and ruin between 1977 and 1981 a total of five mills were closed and approximately 25000 jobs were lost countywide meetings of union officials and mill bosses were hurriedly set up in an attempt to persuade the powers that be to reconsider their statement however it was clear that in the words of uswa president lloyd mcbride if you cant make a buck you get out of the business the closings meant the end of youngstowns only real industry the end of its population growth and then end of economic progress without the mills people sought other places of employment in adjoining states or even other areas of the country those that could afford to move did so those that couldnt afford to move mostly ended up on the streets without an industrial or a residential base commerce shrank considerably it was becoming increasingly clear that without the industrial base provided by the mills the city of youngstown would soon become a ghost town inhabited by those too poor or hopeful to escape the workers decided they needed to do something to save their city and so they mobilized in a variety of ways attempts to save the mills the very first thing that the workers could do was to get up a petition to stop the shutdown says ed mann a local union leader and organizer the petition was circulated eventually including thousands of signatures it was then given to uswa representatives to present to president carter in washington however the representatives were shunted to the side and ignored in washington since youngstowns political influence had died with its industry the international chapter of the uswa had much more lobbying power but they refused to support the local union members the petition was lost among paperwork and bureaucratic procedure next workers decided to form the ecumenical coalition an organization of local religious groups which spearheaded the attempt to reopen the youngstown works the coalition drafter letters to the lykes company asking if a group of workers might purchase the mill and run it collectively lykes ignored the letters so the coalition turned once again to the federal government here too they were ignored the coalition had no proper funds to buy the mills so they could do nothing but sit back and watch as the mills closed finally following the shutdown of us steels plant in 1980 local union leaders congregated outside the us steel headquarters in youngstown they invited local people and politicians to witness the scene then charged the headquarters and took it over the workers stayed there until the next day when us steel declared that they were ready to talk about selling the mill immediately after the workers left the building us steel representatives told the local union leaders that they had changed their minds and were no longer interested in allowing the workers to purchase the mill all these efforts eventually came to nothing and youngstowns steel mills remained closed these attempts to save the mills were hindered by several major factors including the decline of the world steel market which made american steel impossible to sell or export the decline of the world market the efforts to save the mills failed partly because the international market for steel had largely dried up during world war ii the rest of the world was hungry for americas iron and steel products however by the seventies no foreign nations needed to import steel in such large quantities in fact american steel imports were beginning to outweigh exports foreign steel was easier and more efficient to make and was often of higher quality than domestic steel foreign steel companies invested in their factories updating their technology and replacing their equipment often this meant that foreign facilities were more modern and efficient than any plants in america and therefore were able to export a more competitive product foreign steel was also much cheaper wage hikes although they helped to improve living conditions of steel workers in the us made american steel far more expensive also international competitors drew on a large supply of very cheap labor jobs were scarce in other steelexporting countries and labor laws were either nonexistent or allowed employers to pay much less for work labor costs in america continued to go up draining us companies of their resources while companies overseas were able to cut labor costs and put that money back into updating and renovating their facilities on a worldwide scale newer materials such as aluminum plastic and composites were beginning to substitute steel both at home and abroad steel demand worldwide was beginning to decline and it affected both domestic and foreign companies however to american companies already suffering financial setbacks outdated machinery and fierce competition this lack of demand was an inconvenience they could not afford americas steel remained unsold flooding the world market with inferior products that no one wanted to buy since this problem was a national one rather than a local one the problems that were occurring in youngstown were not unique youngstown was perhaps hit harder than any other town by the collapse of the steel industry but it was not alone the problem was a national one involving many more mills and issues than youngstowns alone j philip richley a union member and organizer of many attempts to save 5the mills has summed it up thus you just cant solve a nationwide problem in a single city the decline of the world steel market affected not just youngstown but the entire steel community in america trying to prop up one citys mills was impossible when faced with the depression that spread throughout the entire industry the save our valley campaign lack of funds and plans eventually some religious leaders involved in the ecumenical coalition joined forces within community members and former steel mill employees to create the save our valley campaign as the name suggests local leaders wanted to instill the people of youngstown with a fierce sense of urgency driving them forward to confront steel companies and owners and help secure the future of the region marches speeches and letter writing were all employed to help stimulate the campaign and rally the people but the campaign was bogged down heavily by the lack of proper funding the people of youngstown being now unemployed had very little money to spend on anything but staying alive college tuition clothes food and heating all had to come before donations to nonprofit organizations people outside of the area had no personal investment in the mills and so it was difficult to convince anyone from out of the county to contribute funds the lack of money proved to be crippling because it prevented the organizations involved from purchasing the mills to run collectively without funds the save our valley campaign could do nothing major to help salvage the citys dying economy the save our valley campaign also lacked one essential component an actual concrete plan no one seemed to know just how to go about fixing the problems letters and petitions were all very well but they did little to improve the situation people clung to vague ideas of worker collectivization but no one could really fathom exactly how that would work the people of youngstown were after all not particularly familiar with socialism or collectivization in general beyond that no one knew how they should proceed everyone knew that saving the mills was important but nobody stepped forward with a fullfledged plan to do it without losing huge amounts of money and dragging even more people down without a real plan nothing could truly be achieved without funds to drive the efforts or even a real plan of action the save our valley campaign did more harm than good in effect it raised the hopes of workers without having any real chance at saving anything people became excited and waited for the mills to reappear but they never did the campaign failed to save any jobs and youngstown was plunged into economic chaos the apathy of uswa united steel workers of america was the union representing the youngstown steel workers when the closings hit initially many assumed that their union would take a lead role in fighting for the recovery of their jobs however it soon became clear that although the local union leaders were prepared to fight the international branch was not the higher levels of the union became increasingly disassociated with youngstown and its plight attempting to shut out the appeals from workers and local union representatives and to ignore what was really happening actually one main reason for the behavior of the uswa was that union leaders really had no idea what to do no one had ever seen a shutdown of this magnitude and rapidity before and none of the leaders of uswa not even president lynn williams knew what could be done it was clear to everyone that the economic fallout from this series of closings would be one of the worst in us history and so without any real precedents the union leaders were flustered rather than try and come up with some sort of scenario the uswa simply ignored what was going on in youngstown hoping that perhaps the problem would resolve itself or at least not spread any further than it already had besides incompetence the uswa had one other major reason for rejecting their local counterpart fear of socialism obviously the union itself was not afraid of socialist action but they worried that the federal government might see the efforts of youngstown workers to collectivize as a movement towards socialism and perhaps even communism if the uswa supported the efforts to revive the mills and encouraged worker control and ownership of the factories then the government and potentially other important people and institutions as well might begin to think that the uwsa leaders were encouraging socialism this would mean that uwsa would lose credibility with the american government and its people something they could not afford to do therefore they decided to withdraw support and let the local branch fight it out alone regionalism from its very first days the mahoning valley has been an area packed with small villages and hamlets youngstown is the name of the major city area but surrounding it on all sides are small communities which to the casual viewer are indistinguishable from the main city itself boardman poland township struthers lowellville warren lordstown canfield niles and many other towns and districts are crowded around youngstown see figure 3 people from each town work shop eat and socialize in towns separate from their own making each town strongly dependent on every other town however although traffic is heavy between each separate district each area has its own distinct cultural ethnicity educational system heritage history and even food for example struthers is a poor town with a large slovak population where education is generally better than in surrounding towns but unemployment is much higher and pollution is widespread most people in struthers are either orthodox or baptist two blocks over one finds boardman a welloff township with a reputation for rich but unsuccessful schools its residents are mainly italian and roman catholic with a small concentration of methodists on the east side unemployment is low in comparison with surrounding towns and the streets are clean and well kept with many more cultures religions and economic levels living in close proximity to one another a curious phenomenon has overtaken the area regionalism each town with their own identity instills a strong regionalistic feeling within their respective populations which dictates many habits exchanges and interactions between populations oftentimes this regionalism takes the form of bizarre forms of hatred with certain towns becoming sworn enemies of others with so much regional tension it became very hard for workers to unite under a common cause even one that would save their jobs and their futures workers from poland township would refuse to attend rallies with workers from campbell and citizens of struthers would become suspicious of people from boardman even if they were supposed to be working towards the same thing a lack of cooperation became a crippling problem for the movement because no one was willing to put aside regional differences to work together in some instances small companies would express interest in helping the movement or in relocating their business in the area but because of regional pride no one could ever agree where the new businesses should relocate in this way the people of the mahoning valley missed many opportunities for new industrial or commercial lifeblood because of arbitrary arguments where the goal was simply to protect regional pride conclusion the aftershock and the significance of black monday black monday was a devastating blow to an entire generation of people the efforts to avoid catastrophe after the fact were unsuccessful for four main reasons the failure of the international steel market the lack of funds and plans in initiatives such as the save our valley campaign the refusal of the uswa to support their local chapter out of ineptitude and fear and the absurd but very real regionalism which corrupted solidarity efforts and drove away any hope for brining in new companies what happened in youngstown may not seem significant on an international or even on a national level and perhaps it is not but to the thousands of people living there the loss of the mills was a devastating event that sent shock waves through their economic political and social futures because of the mills and their conspicuous absence hundreds of people were uprooted forced to leave their homes and tightly knit communities hundreds more joined the unemployment lines or even began living on the streets for the people of youngstown black monday was not just a historical event it was the most important event in their lives the steel workers who tried to save their jobs and their lives were part of something greater than themselves something which would endure long after they had moved away and moved on even though they eventually failed the fact that they tried to preserve what they felt belonged to them is an amazing example of how far people will go to save their lives and the futures of their children 
 may 18 2006 anth 250 prof tavrez indigenous revitalization movements of latin america the rediscovery of language and identity humans in the process of defining themselves look to immediately recognizable factors in order to differentiate themselves from others this process leads to the development of what can be broadly termed culture a group of people joined by characteristics traits and beliefs comes to view themselves as sharing a distinct identity discernible from that of those outside them those who do not belong naturally this can be signaled by any number of things clothing food lifestyle choices one of the most dominant and easily noted factors is language the command of a language while not affording guaranteed access to the community which speaks it is often the key to gaining entry in turn communal identity can be formed around a language it is used as the focal point around which the group gathers therefore when considering the indigenous revitalization movements which began in 20th century latin america the impact of those indigenous languages on those movements and the nature of the identity of the peoples themselves is key language plays a complex and integral role in the development and redefinition of an identity particularly when that identity has been oppressed and subsumed by a dominant other for as long as that of the indigenous peoples in latin america has in particular i will examine two divergent yet remarkably parallel cases that of the maya in guatemala and the nasa and guambiano peoples of colombia their struggle to attain status in societies still bearing the marks of spanish colonialism is deeply tied to their struggle to reaffirm the nature of their indigenous identity and is in turn linked to the interaction of spanish and their native languages the effects of spanish colonialism are both farreaching and deeply embedded in both countries one of the most prominent lasting influences is that of the land grant system initially the spanish government attempted to instate the encomienda system in which a conquistador maintained direct control over the indigenous peoples and their land this was in turn replaced by the repartimento the natives were allowed to maintain control over their land and their laws but remained in every way the inferior of the spanish providing labor and taxes as demanded in reality land ownership rights were the exclusive right of the spanish resulting in modernday malappropriation of land ownership in the hands of the descendants of the spanish colonialists warren 1978 78 indigenous peoples are commonly sharecroppers or migrant workers the impoverished plight of the native populations was first recognized by the marxist movements of the early 20th century those were the first to articulate the necessity of affirming the independent identity of the indigenous populations previously both the left and right maintained a belief in indigenous assimilation into the dominant spanish culture the marxists on the contrary argued that the indigenous peoples possessed a unique identity however they also claimed that they were part of a larger group the working class whose poverty was a direct result of american imperialism therefore they should join these new popular leftist movements in order to reorganize society into a workerfriendly one jackson 1995 67 in colombia this resulted in a civil war between the liberal and communist parties and conservative party a truce established between the liberals and conservatives failed to meet the demands of the communists who in turn sustained guerrilla attacks in response guerrilla warfare has since become a part of colombian life multiple groups maintain an ongoing presence often stationing themselves in the remote mountainous villages often populated by various indigenous peoples this is similar to the situation of guatemala the government felt it needed to battle communism an armed and dangerous menace within plunging the country into civil warfare in the 1960s and continuing through the 1980s warren 1993 25 this resulted in persecution against the mayans who make up about 60 of the overall population in both counties guerrillas were often associated with the native peoples in many cases there were coalitions but in others the guerrillas merely used the remote inaccessible villages as hideouts in guatemala over 450 villages were destroyed 200000 mayans were killed and over 1 million more were displaced the main guerrilla force was demilitarized in 1996 with the establishment of a peace accord warren 2002 157158 the growth in popularity and militarism of these popular leftist movements is intertwined with the development of the indigenous revitalization movements by the 1970s the need to assert a cause separate from the general left was seen and indigenous rights movements formed warren 2003 174 jackson 2002 82 central to these was the question of indigenous identity largely lost amidst the overwhelming spanish influence local leaders sought to rediscover their native roots and redefine what it meant to be a part of indigenous culture panmayanism in particular has sought to organize itself around the mayan language despite local dialectical differences it is seen as the unifying force behind the diverse mayan people most still speak it in various forms and efforts by mayan linguists to standardize the language are producing a coherent modern version of maya england 2003 733 739 panmayanism has succeeded in part due to its focus on issues of ethnicity it largely avoids specifically political overtones instead concentrating on the development of the reemerging mayan culture england 2003 734 the popular left however continues to see the rhetoric of ethnic rights as a politically viable tool it therefore often invokes the banner of indigenous rights in its own discourse the panmayan movement thus benefits from the lasting influence of the popular left on guatemalan governmental policies without risking drawing the often negative attention of the government england 2003 735 warren 2003 181 a main concern among panmayanists is the reversal of the longseated inferiority complex of the mayan people despite their position as majority within the guatemalan population they remain impoverished and marginalized on the fridge of society this results in part from the ingrained influences of spanish colonialism spanish continues to be associated with modernity and social mobility whereas maya is seen as backward and inferior panmayan leaders therefore seek to develop a return to maya as it was in its classical renaissance a language of power and prestige england 2003 736 by doing so they hope to inculcate among the mayan peoples a renewed sense of pride which will in turn reverse the dogma of spanish superiority colombia in contrast has no unified panindian sentiments the indigenous population is a small fraction of the overall population a fractured entity divided by region and language several competing and oftentimes conflicting indigenous rights advocacy groups have developed the onic poses itself as the sole panindian group yet lacks legitimacy in the eyes of many indigenous peoples jackson 2002 83 85 the cric which focuses on language development and renewal is primarily representative of the nasa peoples jackson 2003 82 it often stands in conflict with the aico its guambiano counterpart jackson 2003 8384 whereas the mayanists benefit from a single main identity those of colombia must operate under historical differences between the various ethnic groups jackson 2002 109 the nasa and guambiano have stood in opposition since precolonial times therefore any coalition between the two advocacy groups is tenuous at best rappaport 2005 2 this reflects a desire among the peoples themselves to maintain distinct ethnic identities both from the spanish colombian population and each other in the 1990s the rhetoric of cultural diversity was picked up the colombian media and subsequently entered the consciousness of the greater metropolitan public thereby cementing its place in colombian society as necessity and further complicating the role of indigenous movements in gaining rights for indigenous peoples as a whole a major success in the colombian saga is the revamped constitution of 1991 which includes a section on indigenous rights as the congress which drafted it included representatives from native groups gow and rappaport 2002 57 central is a return to the old land grant system stemming from the repartimentos of the colonial era along with judicial sovereignty while the repartimento was originally used to repress the indigenous groups it is now used to support them resguardos or communally owned plots of land are granted to communities they are ruled by the cabildo local governing boards formed of community leaders gow and rappaport 2002 5152 the return to customary law reflects a substantial shift in indigenous identity no longer ruled by western laws and discourse communities are forced to assess the efficacy of their old judicial systems in light of the modern era the oral nature of jurisprudence directly conflicts with the desire of the colombian government to codify law and questions of human rights violations are common as punishments are often corporal in nature gow and rappaport 2002 5758 the colombian constitution stands in stark contrast to the failure of the guatemalan indigenous rights referendum of 1999 mayans gained formal recognition in 1995 as the majority population in a precursor to the 1996 peace accord by 1999 its government floated a referendum on an indigenous bill of rights resembling that codified in the colombian constitution warren 2002 157158 it failed despite the mayan majority possible reasons include the overwhelming illiteracy rates among the indigenous population and inaccessibility of voting stations warren 2002 149 151 however it reflects on a greater level both the desire of many mayans to assimilate as they still feel that is necessary for social mobility and a belief among the general population that mayans do not require a separate bill of rights as they are covered under the general rights already in the constitution warren 2002 159 172 illiteracy rates are in fact correlated with the mayan language itself those who speak spanish are more likely to be literate than those who speak mayan alone england 2003 733 nonetheless in 2003 the legislature passed the law of national languages which while reaffirming spanish as the official language recognizes the importance of indigenous languages as part of national identity and encourages their active promotion while largely symbolic it is still significant in that guatemalan identity is seen as encompassing languages other than spanish this question of identity as defined by language manifests differently in guatemala and colombia within the panmayan movement there remains a desire to maintain linguistic diversity some view the reduction of their language to the status of dialect devalues their unique identity and place in the mayan world however despite differences over standardization the panmayan movement itself is largely cohesive in contrast colombian indigenous groups are divided to the extent that linguistic diversity is not only valued but serves to split the population both between groups and within groups themselves an example is the tukanoans while considered a single ethnic group they maintain 16 distinct language groups and practice linguistic exogamy in which members of one language group must marry into another jackson 1995 4 language further works to establish identity by encapsulating a worldview markedly removed from that of the dominant western culture indigenous cosmology or cosmovision is difficult to translate into romanticized languages it maintains a concept of culture defined as the form of behavior resulting from a permanent harmonic relationship with nature gow and rappaport 2002 58 and view of history as cyclic that is often at odds with western modes of thought conflict between cultures arise as cosmovision is rediscovered and developed often by native shamans in tandem with indigenous leaders aided by outside researchers and nongovernmental organizations the differences between western and native perceptions then lead to conflict within the revitalization movements themselves the question of embracing western law and discourse is continually grappled with it is necessary to work within the national legal system in order to gain policy reform beyond the local level however with widely differing concepts of justice a a balance is difficult to achieve customary law in colombia contrasts with western law as it maintains a different perception of casual relationships tying back to the indigenous concept of harmony crimes are viewed as imbalances in the communitys harmony and can often be traced back to those who did not perpetuate the crime but may have influenced the accused to do so when a punishment often public and corporal in nature is carried out the group feels the effects as a whole shamans often sit with the criminal as he fills his sentence sharing in their ordeal rappaport 2005 once punishments are completed the criminal is seen as rehabilitated having fulfilled his duty to restore harmonic order and is welcomed back into the community gow and rappaport 2002 61 rappaport 2005 97 translation of law into native languages has proved to be a difficult task as western ideas often have no parallel in indigenous cosmovision the translation of the colombian constitution sparked the development of neologisms as the goal of the translators was not to provide a direct translation of the constitution but to recapture its spirit in a native rather than western discourse gow and rappaport 2002 5859 this provides a second interpretation of law distinct from that of the spanish colombian culture and in turn an interpretation aligned with native ideology for the cabildos to follow when governing rappaport 2005 93 236 translation fulfills another vital role as it is employed in the rediscovery of the indigenous identity itself workshops and advocacy groups regularly work to translate native histories back into native forms of knowledge distancing them from the western influences that have invaded over the past six centuries the guambiano history project charts native history as the outward spiraling events which are both cyclic and parallel in nature mayan historians translate and document oral histories whose legacy is in danger of being forgotten rappaport 2005 165 this attempt to regain identity via translation is indicative of the intimate relationship between indigenous revitalization within a modern context and native language use difficulties arise however as conflicts between the traditional and modern and native languages and spanish develop many native peoples in colombia are monolingual spanish speakers raising the question of the practicality of indigenous language use the differences between cosmovision in spanish and indigenous languages are great leading to the difficulty of governing in spanish yet embracing indigenous mode of thought in addition there exists a complex relationship between what are perceived as different levels of indigenous identity the nasa for example divide themselves into the traditional modern and new the authenticity of the modern nasa who are often metropolitan spanish speakers attempting to reconnect with their roots is brought into question by the traditional who speak nasa yuwe and lead a rural existencerappaport 2005 in guatemala the fact remains that spanish is the gateway to social mobility years of conflict and refugee status have established the desire to leave a rural way of life for an updated urban one and those literate in spanish have the tools to do so illiteracy and poverty is associated with maya thus there is the conflict between the desire to recapture the unique mayan identity via the language and the need to improve living conditions which most often occurs under spanish influence a further complication is the necessity of establishing authentic indianness both in the eyes of fellow indigenous peoples and the outside spanish culture the onic of colombia lacks legitimacy precisely because it is perceived as not indian enough it embraces the use of spanish and western discourse leading to distrust among indigenous peoples jackson 2002 85 politicians make a point of appearing in their native dress and speaking in their native language in assembly even if they are more at home in a business suit and speaking spanish indigenous identity has become a calling card to the extent that at times it appears to be a caricature of itself the colombian constitution is problematic in that it provides little guide as to what exactly forms an indigenous group the concept of culture is so complex and divergent that establishing selfdetermination in the eyes of the colombian government requires emphasizing differences efforts towards development then cannot endanger traditional culture and values for fear of losing cultural legitimacy jackson 1995 5 there develops a duality in native culture for example many nasa children receive instruction in nasa yuwe yet converse in spanish outside the classroom an emphasis on preserving rather than practicing native culture arises indigenous authenticity is maintained by sustaining knowledge of traditional practices and beliefs without fully embracing them on a daytoday basis gow and rappaport 2002 6667 this intersection of language and indigenous identity poses challenges which have yet to be fully addressed in guatemala they are largely comprised of the conflict between poverty and progress the panmayan movement must meet the dual trials of establishing a positive identity within the mayan population itself and legitimacy in the legal and political arenas in order to gain policy reforms and codified rights in law in colombia legal successes have often come about due to the colombian governments recognition of the political viability of the rhetoric of indigenous rights by granting indigenous peoples judicial sovereignty they hope to win the trust of a people who view the government as incapable of protecting them from the ongoing civil strife and by giving them blocks of land they hope that the indigenous community will be able to keep out drug traffickers and guerrillas where the government itself has not jackson 1995 8 regardless of the ulterior motives behind their legal status indigenous peoples in colombia now possess the rights to teach and govern in their own languages according to their own laws jackson 1995 5 conflicts arise due to internal differences and the everpersist problem of

move silently invisibly and extremely quickly but she was very observant she climbed down from the tree using her stealth power to get next to the boy running into step with him he looked over at her

replied they both disappeared veering invisibly off to the left the two men came to a halt not knowing where the youths had gone melody and the boy could still see each other in a sort of mirror world

dropping back to the dull grass at first i thought that the winged shape in the sky was a sparrow and i was glad that a bird had come out for it was lonely with just the hissing wind for company but as it descended it grew larger it was a goose no all the geese had left for the winter and it was too large now what was it an eagle could it be no it was too large and its wings werent open it wasnt

have saved its life for the tree slowed its fall enough so that when it fell out of the tree it was not hurt as badly as it would have been if it had landed on the cold hard ground first i ran up to it filled first with excitement and then with concern it was moaning and occasionally it uttered a lamenting phrase in some incomprehensible language and tears ran down its face i saw that instead of a normal nose and mouth it had a curved birds beak of the sort that eagles have i knelt beside it not sure if i should move it inside or if moving it might just injure it more the bonesetter thyme

road the bonesetter lived not far away from my house in a oncecolorful gypsy caravan where he did his work as a child i had been terrified of the caravan partly because the bonesetter growled and snapped at the village children but also because of the bloodcurdling screams that came from inside when people were having their broken bones set so they would heal properly breathless i arrived at the caravan door and knocked sharply upon it i knew that the bonesetter would not answer unless it was an emergency so i kept knocking until he opened the door and snarled what is it you want that you must make such a racket on my door you must come i said gasping its hurt i dont treat animals he said starting to close the door i put my foot in the wayits not an animal i said its an angel awakening

explore his thighs and the space between he gasps his eyes wide open now something in her touch has reawakened a long lost memory and he is turned on the water is soothing and he moves with her tuning into the rhythm of her moving hand his mind elsewhere in the past he is imagining that day long ago when that very special person did the same thing and he fell in love experiment no 1 stovohobo

 a wasted day richard harding part one when its turn came the private secretary somewhat apologetically laid the letter in front of the wisest man in wall street from mrs austin probation officer court of general sessions he explained wants a letter about spear hes been convicted of theft comes up for sentence tuesday spear repeated arnold thorndike young fellow stenographer used to do your letters last summer going in and out on the train the great man nodded i remember what about him the habitual gloom of the private secretary was lightened by a grin went on the loose had with him about five hundred dollars belonging to the firm hes with isaacs sons now shoe people on sixth avenue met a woman and woke up without the money the next morning he offered to make good but isaacs called in a policeman when they looked into it they found the boy had been drunk they tried to withdraw the charge but hed been committed now the probation officer is trying to get the judge to suspend sentence a letter from you sir would it was evident the mind of the great man was elsewhere young men who drunk or sober spent the firms money on women who disappeared before sunrise did not appeal to him another letter submitted that morning had come from his art agent in europe in florence he had discovered the correggio he had been sent to find it was undoubtedly genuine and he asked to be instructed by cable the price was forty thousand dollars with one eye closed and the other keenly regarding the inkstand mr thorndike decided to pay the price and with the facility of long practice dismissed the correggio and snapped his mind back to the present spear had a letter from us when he left didnt he he asked what he has developed into since he left us he shrugged his shoulders the secretary withdrew the letter and slipped another in its place homer firth the landscape man he chanted wants permission to use blue flint on the new road with turf gutters and to plant silver firs each side says it will run to about five thousand dollars a mile no protested the great man firmly blue flint makes a country place look like a cemetery mine looks too much like a cemetery now landscape gardeners he exclaimed impatiently their only idea is to insult nature the place was better the day i bought it when it was running wild you could pick flowers all the way to the gates pleased that it should have recurred to him the great man smiled why spear he exclaimed always took in a bunch of them for his mother dont you remember we used to see him before breakfast wandering around the grounds picking flowers mr thorndike nodded briskly i like his taking flowers to his mother he said it was to his mother suggested the secretary gloomily well he picked the flowers anyway laughed mr thorndike he didnt pick our pockets and he had the run of the house in those days as far as we know he dictated he was satisfactory dont say more than that the secretary scribbled a mark with his pencil and the landscape man tell him commanded thorndike i want a wood road suitable to a farm and to let the trees grow where god planted them as his car slid downtown on tuesday morning the mind of arnold thorndike was occupied with such details of daily routine as the purchase of a railroad the japanese loan the new wing to his art gallery and an attack that morning in his own newspaper upon his pet trust but his busy mind was not too occupied to return the salutes of the traffic policemen who cleared the way for him or by some genius of memory to recall the fact that it was on this morning young spear was to be sentenced for theft it was a charming morning the spring was at full tide and the air was sweet and clean mr thorndike considered whimsically that to send a man to jail with the memory of such a morning clinging to him was adding a year to his sentence he regretted he had not given the probation officer a stronger letter he remembered the young man now and favorably a shy silent youth deft in work and at other times conscious and embarrassed but that on the part of a stenographer in the presence of the wisest man in wall street was not unnatural on occasions mr thorndike had put even royalty frayed impecunious royalty on the lookout for a loanat its ease the hood of the car was down and the taste of the air warmed by the sun was grateful it was at this time a year before that young spear picked the spring flowers to take to his mother a year from now where would young spear be it was characteristic of the great man to act quickly so quickly that his friends declared he was a slave to impulse it was these same impulses leading so invariably to success that made his enemies call him the wisest man he leaned forward and touched the chauffeurs shoulder stop at the court of general sessions he commanded what he proposed to do would take but a few minutes a word a personal word from him to the district attorney or the judge would be enough he recalled that a sunday special had once calculated that the working time of arnold thorndike brought him in two hundred dollars a minute at that rate keeping spear out of prison would cost a thousand dollars out of the sunshine mr thorndike stepped into the gloom of an echoing rotunda shut in on every side hung by balconies lit many stories overhead by a dirty skylight the place was damp the air acrid with the smell of stale tobacco juice and foul with the presence of many unwashed humans a policeman chewing stolidly nodded toward an elevator shaft and other policemen nodded him further on to the office of the district attorney there arnold thorndike breathed more freely he was again among his own people he could not help but appreciate the dramatic qualities of the situation that the richest man in wall street should appear in person to plead for a humble and weaker brother he knew he could not escape recognition his face was too well known but he trusted for the sake of spear the reporters would make no display of his visit with a deprecatory laugh he explained why he had come but the outburst of approbation he had anticipated did not follow the district attorney ran his finger briskly down a printed card henry spear he exclaimed thats your man part three judge fallon andrews is in that court he walked to the door of his private office andrews he called he introduced an alert broadshouldered young man of years of much indiscretion and with a charming and inconsequent manner mr thorndike is interested in henry spear coming up for sentence in part three this morning wants to speak for him take him over with you the district attorney shook hands quickly and retreated to his private office mr andrews took out a cigarette and as he crossed the floor lit it come with me he commanded somewhat puzzled slightly annoyed but enjoying withal the novelty of the environment and the curtness of his reception mr thorndike followed he decided that in his ignorance he had wasted his own time and that of the prosecuting attorney he should at once have sent in his card to the judge as he understood it mr andrews was now conducting him to that dignitary and in a moment he would be free to return to his own affairs which were the affairs of two continents but mr andrews led him to an office bare and small and offered him a chair and handed him a morning newspaper there were people waiting in the room strange people only like those mr thorndike had seen on ferryboats they leaned forward toward young mr andrews fawning their eyes wide with apprehension mr thorndike refused the newspaper i thought i was going to see the judge he suggested court doesnt open for a few minutes yet said the assistant district attorney judge is always late anyway mr thorndike suppressed an exclamation he wanted to protest but his clear mind showed him that there was nothing against which with reason he could protest he could not complain because these people were not apparently aware of the sacrifice he was making he had come among them to perform a kindly act he recognized that he must not stultify it by a show of irritation he had precipitated himself into a game of which he did not know the rules that was all next time he would know better next time he would send a clerk but he was not without a sense of humor and the situation as it now was forced upon him struck him as amusing he laughed goodnaturedly and reached for the desk telephone may i use this he asked he spoke to the wall street office he explained he would be a few minutes late he directed what should be done if the market opened in a certain way he gave rapid orders on many different matters asked to have read to him a cablegram he expected from petersburg and one from vienna they answer each other was his final instruction it looks like peace mr andrews with genial patience had remained silent now he turned upon his visitors a levantine burly unshaven and soiled towered truculently above him young mr andrews with his swivel chair tilted back his hands clasped behind his head his cigarette hanging from his lips regarded the man dispassionately you gotta hell of a nerve to come to see me he commented cheerfully to mr thorndike the form of greeting was novel so greatly did it differ from the procedure of his own office that he listened with interest was it you demanded young andrews in a puzzled tone or your brother who tried to knife me mr thorndike unaccustomed to cross the pavement to his office unless escorted by bank messengers and plainclothes men felt the room growing rapidly smaller the figure of the truculent greek loomed to heroic proportions the hand of the banker went vaguely to his chin and from there fell to his pearl pin which he hastily covered get out said young andrews and dont show your face here the door slammed upon the flying greek young andrews swung his swivel chair so that over his shoulder he could see mr thorndike i dont like his face he explained a kindly eyed sad woman with a basket on her knee smiled upon andrews with the familiarity of an old acquaintance is that woman going to get a divorce from my son she asked now that hes in trouble now that hes in sing sing corrected mr andrews i hope so she deserves it that son of yours mrs bernard he declared emphatically is no good the brutality shocked mr thorndike for the woman he felt a thrill of sympathy but at once saw that it was superfluous from the secure and lofty heights of motherhood mrs bernard smiled down upon the assistant district attorney as upon a naughty child she did not even deign a protest she continued merely to smile the smile reminded thorndike of the smile on the face of a mother in a painting by murillo he had lately presented to the chapel in the college he had given to his native town that son of yours repeated young andrews is a leech hes robbed you robbed his wife best thing i ever did for you was to send him up the river the mother smiled upon him beseechingly could you give me a pass she said young andrews flung up his hands and appealed to thorndike isnt that just like a mother he protested that son of hers has broken her heart tramped on her cheated her hasnt left her a cent and she comes to me for a pass so she can kiss him through the bars and ill bet shes got a cake for him in that basket the mother laughed happily she knew now she would get the pass mothers explained mr andrews from the depth of his wisdom are all like that your mother my mother if you went to jail your mother would be just like that mr thorndike bowed his head politely he had never considered going to jail or whether if he did his mother would bring him cake in a basket apparently there were many aspects and accidents of life not included in his experience young andrews sprang to his feet and with the force of a hose flushing a gutter swept his soiled visitors into the hall come on he called to the wisest man the court is open in the corridors were many people and with his eyes on the broad shoulders of the assistant district attorney thorndike pushed his way through them the people who blocked his progress were of the class unknown to him their looks were anxious furtive miserable they stood in little groups listening eagerly to a sharpfaced lawyer or in sullen despair eying each other at a door a tipstaff laid his hand roughly on the arm of mr thorndike thats all right joe called young mr andrews hes with me they entered the court and passed down an aisle to a railed enclosure in which were high oak chairs again in his effort to follow mr thorndike was halted but the first tipstaff came to his rescue all right he signalled hes with mr andrews mr andrews pointed to one of the oak chairs you sit there he commanded its reserved for members of the bar but its all right youre with me distinctly annoyed slightly bewildered the banker sank between the arms of a chair he felt he had lost his individuality andrews had become his sponsor because of andrews he was tolerated because andrews had a pull he was permitted to sit as an equal among policecourt lawyers no longer was he arnold thorndike he was merely the man with mr andrews then even andrews abandoned him the judgell be here in a minute now said the assistant district attorney and went inside a railed enclosure in front of the judges bench there he greeted another assistant district attorney whose years were those of even greater indiscretion than the years of mr andrews seated on the rail with their hands in their pockets and their backs turned to mr thorndike they laughed and talked together the subject of their discourse was one mike donlin as he appeared in vaudeville to mr thorndike it was evident that young andrews had entirely forgotten him he arose and touched his sleeve with infinite sarcasm mr thorndike began my engagements are not pressing but a court attendant beat with his palm upon the rail sit down whispered andrews the judge is coming mr thorndike sat down the court attendant droned loudly words mr thorndike could not distinguish there was a rustle of silk and from a door behind him the judge stalked past he was a young man the type of the tammany politician on his shrewd alert irishamerican features was an expression of unnatural gloom with a smile mr thorndike observed that it was as little suited to the countenance of the young judge as was the robe to his shoulders mr thorndike was still smiling when young andrews leaned over the rail stand up he hissed mr thorndike stood up after the court attendant had uttered more unintelligible words every one sat down and the financier again moved hurriedly to the rail i would like to speak to him now before he begins he whispered i cant wait mr andrews stared in amazement the banker had not believed the young man could look so serious speak to him now exclaimed the district attorney youve got to wait till your man comes up if you speak to the judge now the voice of andrews faded away in horror not knowing in what way he had offended but convinced that it was only by the grace of andrews he had escaped a dungeon mr thorndike retreated to his armchair the clock on the wall showed him that already he had given to young spear one hour and a quarter the idea was preposterous no one better than himself knew what his time was really worth in half an hour there was a board meeting later he was to hold a post mortem on a railroad at every moment questions were being asked by telegraph by cable questions that involved the credit of individuals of firms of even the country and the one man who could answer them was risking untold sums only that he might say a good word for an idle apprentice inside the railed enclosure a lawyer was reading a typewritten speech he assured his honor that he must have more time to prepare his case it was one of immense importance the name of a most respectable business house was involved and a sum of no less than nine hundred dollars nine hundred dollars the contrast struck mr thorndikes sense of humor full in the centre unknowingly he laughed and found himself as conspicuous as though he had appeared suddenly in his nightclothes the tipstaffs beat upon the rail the lawyer he had interrupted uttered an indignant exclamation andrews came hurriedly toward him and the young judge slowly turned his head those persons he said who cannot respect the dignity of this court will leave it as he spoke with his eyes fixed on those of mr thorndike the latter saw that the young judge had suddenly recognized him but the fact of his identity did not cause the frown to relax or the rebuke to halt unuttered in even icy tones the judge continued and it is well they should remember that the law is no respecter of persons and that the dignity of this court will be enforced no matter who the offender may happen to be andrews slipped into the chair beside mr thorndike and grinned sympathetically sorry he whispered should have warned you we wont be long now he added encouragingly as soon as this fellow finishes his argument the judgell take up the sentences your man seems to have other friends isaacs sons are here and the typewriter firm who taught him but what you say will help most it wont be more than a couple of hours now a couple of hours mr thorndike raged inwardly a couple of hours in this place where he had been publicly humiliated he smiled a thin sharklike smile those who made it their business to study his expressions on seeing it would have fled young andrews not being acquainted with the moods of the great man added cheerfully by one oclock anyway mr thorndike began grimly to pull on his gloves for all he cared now young spear could go hang andrews nudged his elbow see that old lady in the front row he whispered thats mrs spear what did i tell you mothers are all alike shes not taken her eyes off you since court opened she knows youre her one best bet impatiently mr thorndike raised his head he saw a little white haired woman who stared at him in her eyes was the same look he had seen in the eyes of men who at times of panic fled to him beseeching entreating forcing upon him what was left of the wreck of their fortunes if only he would save their honor and here come the prisoners andrews whispered see spear third man from the last a long line guarded in front and rear shuffled into the courtroom and as ordered ranged themselves against the wall among them were old men and young boys well dressed cleverlooking rascals collarless tramps fierceeyed aliens smoothshaven thinlipped broadwayardsand spear spear his head hanging with lips white and cheeks ashen and his eyes heavy with shame mr thorndike had risen and in farewell was holding out his hand to andrews he turned and across the courtroom the eyes of the financier and the stenographer met at the sight of the great man spear flushed crimson and then his look of despair slowly disappeared and into his eyes there came incredulously hope and gratitude he turned his head suddenly to the wall mr thorndike stood irresolute and then sank back into his chair the first man in the line was already at the railing and the questions put to him by the judge were being repeated to him by the other assistant district attorney and a court attendant his muttered answers were in turn repeated to the judge says hes married naturalized citizen lutheran church die cutter by profession the probation officer her hands filled with papers bustled forward and whispered mrs austin says continued the district attorney shes looked into this case and asks to have the man turned over to her he has a wife and three children has supported them for five years is the wife in court the judge said a thin washedout pretty woman stood up and clasped her hands in front of her has this man been a good husband to you madam asked the young judge the woman broke into vehement assurances no man could have been a better husband would she take him back indeed she would take him back she held out her hands as though she would physically drag her husband from the pillory the judge bowed toward the probation officer and she beckoned the prisoner to her part two other men followed and in the fortune of each mr thorndike found himself to his surprise taking a personal interest it was as good as a play it reminded him of the sicilians he had seen in london in their little sordid tragedies only these actors were appearing in their proper persons in real dramas of a life he did not know but which appealed to something that had been long untouched long in disuse it was an uncomfortable sensation that left him restless because as he appreciated it needed expression an outlet he found this partially in praising through andrews the young judge who had publicly rebuked him mr thorndike found him astute sane his queries intelligent his comments just and this probation officer she too was capable was she not smiling at his interest in what to him was an old story the younger man nodded i like her looks whispered the great man like her clear eyes and clean skin she strikes me as able full of energy and yet womanly these men when they come under her charge he insisted eagerly need money to start again dont they he spoke anxiously he believed he had found the clew to his restlessness it was a desire to help to be of use to these failures who had fallen and who were being lifted to their feet andrews looked at him curiously anything you give her he answered would be well invested if you will tell me her name and address whispered the banker he was much given to charity but it had been perfunctory it was extended on the advice of his secretary in helping here he felt a genial glow of personal pleasure it was much more satisfactory than giving an old master to his private chapel in the rear of the courtroom there was a scuffle that caused every one to turn and look a man who had tried to force his way past the tipstaffs was being violently ejected and as he disappeared he waved a paper toward mr thorndike the banker recognized him as his chief clerk andrews rose anxiously that man wanted to get to you ill see what it is maybe its important mr thorndike pulled him back maybe it is he said dryly but i cant see him now im busy slowly the long line of derelicts of birds of prey of sorry weak failures passed before the seat of judgment mr thorndike had moved into a chair nearer to the rail and from time to time made a note upon the back of an envelope he had forgotten the time or had chosen to disregard it so great was his interest that he had forgotten the particular derelict he had come to serve until spear stood almost at his elbow thorndike turned eagerly to the judge and saw that he was listening to a rotund gray little man with beady birdlike eyes who as he talked bowed and gesticulated behind him stood a younger man a more modern edition of the other he also bowed and behind gold eyeglasses smiled ingratiatingly the judge nodded and leaning forward for a few moments fixed his eyes upon the prisoner you are a very fortunate young man he said he laid his hand upon a pile of letters when you were your own worst enemy your friends came to help you these letters speak for you your employers whom you robbed have pleaded with me in your favor it is urged in your behalf that at the time you committed the crime of which you are found guilty you were intoxicated in the eyes of the law that is no excuse some men can drink and keep their senses it appears you can not when you drink you are a menace to yourselfand as is shown by this crime to the community therefore you must not drink in view of the good character to which your friends have testified and on the condition that you do not touch liquor i will not sentence you to jail but will place you in charge of the probation officer the judge leaned back in his chair and beckoned to mr andrews it was finished spear was free and from different parts of the courtroom people were moving toward the door their numbers showed that the friends of the young man had been many mr thorndike felt a certain twinge of disappointment even though the result relieved and pleased him he wished in bringing it about he had had some part he begrudged to isaacs sons the credit of having given spear his liberty his morning had been wasted he had neglected his own interests and in no way assisted those of spear he was moving out of the railed enclosure when andrews called him by name his honor he said impressively wishes to speak to you the judge leaned over his desk and shook mr thorndike by the hand then he made a speech the speech was about publicspirited citizens who to the neglect of their own interests came to assist the ends of justice and fellowcreatures in misfortune he purposely spoke in a loud voice and every one stopped to listen the law mr thorndike is not vindictive he said it wishes only to be just nor can it be swayed by wealth or political or social influences but when there is good in a man i personally want to know it and when gentlemen like yourself of your standing in this city come here to speak a good word for a man we would stultify the purpose of justice if we did not listen i thank you for coming and i wish more of our citizens were as unselfish and publicspirited it was all quite absurd and most embarrassing but inwardly mr thorndike glowed with pleasure it was a long time since any one had had the audacity to tell him he had done well from the friends of spear there was a ripple of applause which no tipstaff took it upon himself to suppress and to the accompaniment of this mr thorndike walked to the corridor he was pleased with himself and with his fellowmen he shook hands with isaacs sons and congratulated them upon their public spirit and the typewriter firm upon their public spirit and then he saw spear standing apart regarding him doubtfully spear did not offer his hand but mr thorndike took it and shook it and said i want to meet your mother and when mrs spear tried to stop sobbing long enough to tell him how happy she was and how grateful he instead told her what a fine son she had and that he remembered when spear used to carry flowers to town for her and she remembered it too and thanked him for the flowers and he told spear when isaacs sons went bankrupt which at the rate they were giving away their money to the hebrew hospital would be very soon spear must come back to him and isaacs sons were delighted at the great mans pleasantry and afterward repeated it many times calling upon each other to bear witness and spear felt as though some one had given him a new backbone and andrews who was guiding thorndike out of the building was thinking to himself what a great confidence man had been lost when thorndike became a banker the chief clerk and two bank messengers were waiting by the automobile with written calls for help from the office they pounced upon the banker and almost lifted him into the car theres still time panted the chief clerk there is not answered mr thorndike his tone was rebellious defiant it carried all the authority of a spoiled child of fortune ive wasted most of this day he declared and i intend to waste the rest of it andrews he called jump in and ill give you a lunch at sherrys the vigilant protector of the public dashed back into the building wait till i get my hat he called as the two truants rolled up the avenue the spring sunshine warmed them the sense of duties neglected added zest to their holiday and young mr andrews laughed aloud mr thorndike raised his eyebrows inquiringly i was wondering said andrews how much it cost you to keep spear out of jail i dont care said the great man guiltily it was worth it 
 foster a ranney nathans bylichka dedicated to neil gaiman radiohead and black sabbath strange things have always happened to my family it came in through my mothers blood my russian grandmother would always tell me stories bylichkas of ancestors with the second sight stupid mill owners who discovered bags of gold after letting a special fish off their hooks and dark strangers who used to appear to help or interfere at crucial times when i asked her if shed ever seen them before i was old enough to stop believing i mean she would always look sad and tell me no not since the family came to america has anything happened to us but if you ever should see a faerie tell him that you are of the blood of ivan bogatyrivitch and he will not pass you by so quickly as i got older i shook the tales off with a nod and a yes nana i got older and went to school then to college and i replaced the dreams my nana gave me with the music djs mixed for crowds in clubs webs of pulse that shook us until we could believe anything my girlfriend rachel and i would go to the clubs near our school sometimes wed get word that people were gathering under one of the bridges and wed rush down to hit it before the cops broke it up boston is a strange place at night you wouldnt believe half of the shit ive seen even when i was straight it was a friday night rachel and i went out to dinner and when we finished she saw that there was a message on her cell phone she checked it there in the restaurant her head tilted into the phone as she listened her pleather purse on her lap shining jet against the worn black of her snug dead can dance tshirt its from mitch she said folding up the phone he says we should meet him tonight theres a good one going on in that church that closed down last month i dont know it was going to be just us tonight im not sure im up for a night out i was feeling calm and private that night it seemed like tonights darkness was small and personal cupped hands offering a place for two not the burning open darkness of a rave baby lets go its been over a week and i want to dance lets go together you know youll have fun once you get into it she bit the inside of her bottom lip looking at me like i was breaking her poor sweet heart im a sucker for that and she knows it okay rachel lets go youre probably right she grinned and gave me a kiss across the table her lips soft and firm and sticking just enough that she gave the feeling you were really kissing not just pressing your face into someone elses lets not get fucked up tonight though okay rache we dont sure babe come on i dont have to get fucked up every time we go out just to enjoy myself lets not waste any more time she stood up and i followed her out to the street it was dark enough that i could actually see a few stars through the screen of city light without hearing the car horns i could almost taste the air of late march through the street fumes if it was march that meant that wed been together almost a year and a half it was last february after the winter break that we moved in together now spring was back under the concrete and i could smell it even here isnt it an amazing night rache even the city feels alive when spring comes taxi she waved down a car and pulled me in in a few minutes we were getting out a block down from the abandoned church after she paid the driver she grabbed my arm laughing and we ran down the street i heard the pulse already we slammed against the doorway and i was laughing too the pulse close enough to shake the doorframe and set up vibrations in my chest rachel in my arms because shed used me to soften her landing we kissed and slipped inside the old vaulted church was stripped down there was no cloth on the altar just a djs toolkit and his beer through the dark i could see three bolts left in the wall from where theyd taken down the crucifix a confessional too beatenup to have been sold was shaking in a way that suggested activity inside and where the pews had been taken out a couple hundred people were testifying to the djs moving sermon rachel stepped forward into the crowd while i took a moment to drink in the ceilings bluelit shadowed vault and the lightcatching haze from whoknowswhat rising between the dj and the crowd there was a terrific echo each beat reverberating inside of the next and the old stainedglass windows rattled in their frames on the dance floor people moved with their eyes closed and their hands in the air i danced with rachel for a while but then something by the bar seemed to be pulling her eyes she told me that she was heading for a drink and slipped out of the crowd when she hadnt come back halfway through the next song i glanced over at the bar it was just a little setup where someone had stacked a few crates and brought something alcoholic to share mostly beer rachel was standing with a plastic cup looking like she was having a conversation but i couldnt see anyone else there the next time the crowd split i saw him he stood in front of a blue light so i couldnt see him clearly but what i saw was memorable he wore a jacket of what might have been blue velvet and his hair gleamed black against his white skin the blue haze seemed to stop just shy of his pallor setting off his striking face without illuminating its details and his wrists flashed white in the darkness he didnt move just stared and held his drink the next time i saw them his mouth was moving she nodded and he took her arm i watched them through the crush of dancers as they squeezed along the wall and the feeling came to me that something was very wrong saturday morning i woke up and saw that she still hadnt come home i called mitch and our other friends hoping that shed crashed at one of their houses but i had no luck a couple of them remembered seeing her leave but none of them had seen the thin man with her i didnt know how they could miss such exotic features even in that distorting light i caught a taxi back to the church it was still a mess but everything bigger than a soda can had disappeared i walked across what had been the dance floor the church was completely different now sunlight fell through the stained glass catching dust that still hung in the air and sending a dry healthy warmth into the edges of the room through the stone and the powdery concrete that had been covered last night by flesh and flashing lights i realized that rachel had disappeared without leaving a clue and i had no way to do anything but wait for her to show up which if she were in a situation where i should be doing something would probably be never standing in the center of the church i took out my cell phone and called the police i need to file a missing persons report rachel frieze last night walking on west 2nd street around maybe eleven or twelve oclock what but sir this is an unusual situation she didnt come home last night none of her friends have seen her sir if shes in any danger it will probably be too late to help her by that time my girlfriend has disappeared i dont even know where to start looking and i need help yes sir i understand the police wouldnt file a report for someone whod been missing overnight i closed the phone walking out of the church a little gust of cold air caught me by surprise a cold front must have hit while i was inside glancing down the street i realized that i didnt have a friend to drive me home this time and it was a long walk back to the streets where taxis ran i pulled my tshirts sleeves down my arms as far as theyd go but i wasnt ready for cold walking didnt build up much heat it just moved the air enough to chill me more after id walked about a block a car rolled up behind me it slowed down as it neared me and i started to worry this wasnt the best of neighborhoods i kept my eyes straight ahead and tried to walk more quickly without showing it i heard an automatic window roll down hey said a male voice do you need some help i turned around the man looked over forty and he was driving a car id be afraid to drive on this street its a long way to anywhere worth going he said would you like some help ah i think im fine thanks i told him and turned back to the sidewalk really id like to help please hop in you dont look dressed for this weather i glanced back over my shoulder no thanks sir im just fine really dont worry about me nathan spencer i offer you help i advise that you not refuse me a third time i stopped and looked back at him surprised he met my eyes coolly how do you know my name i know your family get in we have a lot of work ahead of us and its best to start now i walked around the car and got into the passenger seat before i had my belt on we were rolling forward okay i said im in the car now will you tell me how you know my family and how you happened to be driving by just now in fact why didnt you call me by name the first time and how did you recognize me when thats enough i can only answer one question at a time i know your family because an ancestor of mine made a bargain with an ancestor of yours i am here now because you called for help and noone else would answer he turned onto the next street and shifted up i will help you find your rachel i have to warn you though you wont like what i have to tell you i shivered something in his tone couldnt be disbelieved tell me anyway if shes in trouble i want to find her wherever she is my driver took a deep breath as he did his neck stretched in a strange way and i noticed several thin lines like wrinkles running across the sides of his neck nathan he began in the way that people speak when they start a long and difficult explanation rachel met someone last night whom it is best never to meet this person like me is not a member of traditional society you see nathan there is separate from your society oh damn it ive never had to give this conversation before come on i have something to show you with that he made a sharp turn onto a side street that i hadnt noticed before we drove between slummy housing and storefronts so decayed that i couldnt tell whether they were abandoned my driver turned again next to an old warehouse that i might have been in once when mitch took us to a rave in sophomore year in front of a few houses there were cars parked but there were almost none on the streets their bumpers looked ready to drop off and their paint was half smog i got a strange feeling that we werent supposed to be driving here hey i said are you sure that we should be going this way i mean just ignore that he told me youll be used to the sensation in a moment that just unnerved me more as we kept driving the anxiety grew more pronounced i noticed that there were some people on the street people the same color as the soiled buildings someone standing just in the lip of an alley glared at me with gleaming eyes okay this is the spot said my driver pulling over he parked and got out is it really safe to leave the car he was already walking toward the squat brickwindowed building we were parked next to glancing back at that gleaming glare i decided that it might be safer to follow the driver than to wait with the car i hopped out ran after him and reached him just as he was knocking on the door someone opened it a crack then ushered us in inside the building opened up the ceiling was high and wooden and i could see part of a djs booth down the hall it looked like we were in the back of a nightclub then i looked down and saw what had let us in nepthys my man what up the hunchbacked being who let us in held out a scraggly paw for him to slap nice my man he said as they clasped hands whos the freak this is someone from ivans family did i ever tell you about them yeah one time man but you were pretty fucked up whats your problem kid the hunchbacked man came up to my stomach his skin was brown and stretched like some diseased saplings bark it pulled back around his fingertips which bore things that might have been nails or claws when he grinned i saw that his teeth were sharp and small like a hunting cats under matted hair his eyes had slit pupils nepthys quickly answered for me girlfriend troubles she came down here with someone after a party and i dont think it was one of your average pixies bummer so whats the cat look like he turned to me nepthys nodded its okay you can trust him thats why we came here it was easier to talk than to question i i noticed him from across the room when i was looking around for rachel he was standing right in front of some blue lights so i couldnt see him very well but i noticed the way that the light set off his pale skin it almost looked like the light bent around him without actually touching him directly he was slim almost drawn but he had a kind of luster to him i guess he wasnt a person youd describe with normal adjectives you know they nodded oh totally said the hunchback i get that all the time around here he was wearing a sort of jacket maybe blue velvet i couldnt tell in the dark but it had ruffles at the throat things like that he really stood out thats why i couldnt understand why noone else remembered him he had some rings too i remember that he hardly ever moved just stared at rachel even when he talked he hardly opened his mouth i dont know how he couldve been heard over the music the two glanced at each other what do you think asked the hunchback ive looked into it a little and i do think we might be dealing with one of them have you seen anyone like that in your club not that i can remember man i can send you to a guy who knows all about them though if this cats for real i bet my friend can tell you everything you need to know youre a wonder dvorov we should head straight over it wont be long before nightfall oh yeah man here let me write down how to find him the hunchback pulled out a scrap of paper and scribbled something on it with his fingernail then handed it to nepthys here you go man good luck thanks dvorov i owe you one lets go that last one was to me i waved goodbye to the hunchback as we left he gave me a halfhearted wave that made me wonder what exactly we were chasing and whether i should be wearing body armor back on the street i began to see things that i had never looked for until then still in my initial shock i suddenly noticed qualities of the people that my mind hadnt registered when we parked i saw people with skin stretched so tightly across their cheekbones that the corners had broken through people whose cheekbones had horns growing from them and people whose skin was gathered back like a ponytail the yellow of this sky wasnt just smog it had a leeching heavy dimness i saw men three feet tall with dusty black skin and eyes that shed yellow light a corpulent batrachian woman walked along with something on a leash that looked like a massive water beetle leaning from the roughhewn window of one building on our right was something with long green hair draped across the seven gangly arms hanging from its windowsill thirtyfive thin fingers waved lazily like seaweed i noticed when my back hit the wall that i was walking backwards we and thousands like us have been living separately as long as there has been a human society said my driver i noticed that the wrinkles on his neck expanded as he breathed and realized that they were gills we interact with humans take advantage of them grant them boons sometimes even become their friends but the majority of both societies have little or no interaction at this point we have removed ourselves so fully from quotidian human existence that we are understood to be fictional the only place with any significant interaction between our worlds is on the fringes of yours loveins raves gatherings where society is put on hold and humans open themselves to emotion that is where entities from this world tend to go when they cross over and that is where rachel met someone from this world those of us who live permanently in this world tend to set up in places like this where the human population is so overwhelming that they wont be noticed in the right corner with the right protective spells he took out the hunchbacks directions and glanced at an alley behind us okay nathan we should get started right away theres no time to waste he saw that i wasnt moving setting an arm on my shoulder he said nathan what you see here might be frightening but those things you saw are people just like you theyll be as surprised to see a human as you are to see men with seven arms thanks its very reassuring that ill not only be an outsider but a curiosity nathan you told me five minutes ago that you would do anything to help rachel well shes here and she needs your help now the more we can do before nightfall the better but why are you even helping me until thirty seconds ago i didnt believe in magic or any of that kind of weirdness nathan i told you my family owes yours a debt in this world ones word is a promise now can we get going i caught my breath and forced myself to look him in the eye only if you stop beginning every sentence with my name youve got a deal lets go as we headed down the sidewalk i said what is your name anyway thats a question you learn not to ask here what you may call me is nepthys holding dvorovs directions nepthys took us around the corner of the building into a skinny alleyway i started wondering again how reliable my guides credentials were walking through an alley with rubbish piles that occasionally skittered from one wall to the other he did not inspire confidence just at this corner he said interrupting my immanent panic attack were going to stop and turn three times widdersh er counterclockwise then face east east is that way he pointed at the wall to our right dont let the sun fool you then im going to shed a little blood but dont worry none of yours i blinked at him but he just kept walking until we reached the corner okay you might feel silly but just turn three times to your left try to keep in time with me we spun around three times and then something flashed across nepthys hand and he shook a spray of blood onto the dust the blood flashed into flames as soon as it hit the ground and i jumped back when it had all burnt a thin outline of a doorframe appeared on the wall across from our corner nepthys walked towards it and pressed his bloody palm against it opening the door are you coming we slipped through the door and came out not inside the building but on a busy street in a completely different part of town the sky cupping over squat buildings was less yellow here and stands were set up everywhere the way id picture a market in the middle east nepthys took us immediately to the right where he led us to a cart filled with herbs spiced air hanging around the cart carried tarragon rosemary and scents i couldnt place the thing tending the cart reminded me of the caterpillar from alice in wonderland it had the same opiumdream wise man quality id always given the caterpillar its arms were thin and long enough to reach any herbs from its cushion in the center of the cart and with its long manyshouldered pole of a torso it rose over our heads even while seated its face was small and wrinkled with pennysized smoked glasses balanced on its thin nose would the gentlemen care to purchase some fine herbs it asked there are no finer to spice a meal nor purer to mix a potion please let yourselves breathe the fine scent of these herbs were not here to browse nepthys told him wed like to see a man about some garlic the thing frowned we have many fine cloves of garlic here on the cart gentle sir if you know what i mean please if we could see him we would be much obliged i imagine that people do not come here for unimportant reasons it hissed thoughtfully true true step behind the cart and enter through the door there using your left hand to open the door and your right he looked at me to close it thank you nepthys bowed slightly and we walked behind the cart the latch opened under nepthys left hand with a clack the door took us to the bottom of a flight of wooden stairs at the top was one door we entered the room held a bed a bookcase and a desk with one chair its only light came from a dying candle on the desk whose spark etched shadows in the roughly planked walls on the bed was a small ratty man i smelled matted hair and cedar chips he opened one eye when we came in but did not move were here for information about a vampire said nepthys oh shit i said sorry kid would you do us the kindness of helping us to identify an individual wait nepthys you said nothing about vampires frankly i dont know if we can even doing anything against a vampire theres an entire industry in my world based around how unkillable they are are look are they as bad as people in my world think they are i dont know theyre almost as rare here and ive never heard a reliable story of someone successfully fighting a vampire only unsuccessfully right no those people dont usually leave stories oh thanks nepthys for your confidenceinspiring tales of experience so theyre probably worse than we think okay thats great now can you tell me what your master plan of attack will be before we go spinning counterclockwise into an anne rice novel my plan is that you shut up while were trying to conduct business with someone who might be able to tell us what were actually going up against okay dont forget shes your girlfriend now calm down while i talk to this gentleman i can hear your heartbeat from over here i shut up and tried to breathe nepthys turned back to the little man on the bed who had not moved please accept our apologies as you can see our situation is of personal importance to the young man now may we ask you a few questions about an individual we believe to be a vampire it would be a great help to us the little man drew a few loud breaths that died in the wooden rooms tight air finally in a pinched rasp he said my information is purely for the purposes of a collector i do not want to provide help to someone who would do harm sir we simply want to discover whether this individual is in fact a vampire if there is any boon that you would have us do in return we would be glad to do it he continued to lie in place still breathing heavily i tried to keep myself calm then with a sigh he said i have need of a certain stone that i once possessed it would allow me to leave this bed despite my current illness my problem is that it was not made in this realm but by a human and only a human may handle it the herb vendor will tell you where you can find it if you would fetch me this stone i would tell you what i can of course we will fetch you the stone nepthys assured him you have our thanks outside the thing at the herb cart nodded when we mentioned the stone he told nepthys the name of a woman who lived on a certain street and we set off when we reached the street i expected some sort of temple or a row of antiquaries or at least a sleazy blackmarket relics merchant instead it looked like we were in the redlight district women who probably wanted more than our money eyed us from the alleys nepthys didnt need to warn me not to speak to them he took us to the door of a building like a short pagoda that had a sign hanging over it showing a face with hands uplifted like a saint under g ds light and handcuffed inside the entrance room was hung with bright silks and scattered with velvet cushions sails of obscene orange and a green that insulted springtime hung draped across reds that might have been sensual elsewhere but here were only offensive a large woman similarly decorated quickly drifted up to us good evening gentlemen she said may i invite you to have a cup of tea no thank you said nepthys we regret that we cannot take up your kind offer are you the proprietor of this shop yes answered the woman i am madame entera at your service how can i help you gentlemen we are here to see about a certain stone she raised an eyebrow are you well we dont get many customers asking about that item please walk this way she led us past the silks and through an arch decorated with pictures of wooden ships and what looked like african tribesmen the next room had mosaics of what could have been rome with men in simple tunics working in a vineyard on one wall and men in odd floppy hats on the other after this we went up a flight of stairs and past a row of doors barred on the outside excuse me i said ignoring nepthys warning look but may i ask what is kept in these rooms the woman laughed why the merchandise of course she said nepthys leaned close to my ear this is a slave shop he explained quietly the woman paused before another door this one not barred but locked as she brought out the key she said we deal mostly in fairly mundane trades but there are a few customers with more unusual needs and people willing to sell unusual items weve had genies indentured sorcerers even golems and the occasional elf this is one of the stranger items though its been in our collection for several years because only a human can activate it if we only had a human on our staff we could have done so ages ago and sold it off but we have no such luck she opened the door and took us past several doors marked with odd geometrical designs to another locked room here it is she said with a flourish she opened the door to reveal a room with walls inlaid with lapis and gold wire intricate patterns like a czars jewelry box crawling down the walls in its center under a spearing white light was a golden table draped with a blue velvet cloth on which lay a gray plumsized rock a marvel isnt it she said that such a rock could hold so much magic its a wonder that it is nepthys assured her what would convince you to part with it she considered this looking him over you wouldnt give me the human would you no she said seeing his expression that would make the stone rather useless nevertheless she gave me what i can only describe as an appraising glance i have never felt so appraised in all my life he looks healthy she said how about a pint of his blood a pint madame i have his health to consider half a pint then and his hair nepthys turned to me well kid what do you think remember this is your quest im not giving my blood as if i wanted it interrupted the woman i think its a fair deal considering the return he told me but its up to you i thought about it then nodded marvelous cried the woman one halfpint of human blood willingly given and his fine head of hair for the stone she took us downstairs to a small room behind a red silk draping there was a wooden chair where she sat me down and asked me to wait soon she came back with a lidded ceramic bowl which she put on the table beside me roll up your sleeves she told me she opened the bowl and carefully gingerly brought out a fat dripping leech it must have been larger than my finger she laid it gently inside the hollow of my left arm the cold thing stretched and cast around with its suckermouth until it found the soft spot inside my elbow where it softly sucked on and began to work its way under my skin i thought that i could feel a slight itching they take about a quarterpint each said madame entera drawing out another skinny leech theyre quick too well be done with them before your hair is finished then she clapped her hands and brought in the barber half an hour later i left the room pale and bald running my fingers over my scalp at least the barber hadnt nicked me madame entera took me back up to the stones room where nepthys was waiting by the door be careful you dont let him touch it until youre ready to use it the woman admonished nepthys as she slipped the stone into a grey cloth pouch and handed it to him thank you for doing business at our house and i hope to see you again i left not a little unnerved and still woozy from the leeches come on said nepthys you could use a drink we hit a bar on the next street over vodka straight up nepthys told the bartender as we sat down at the counter and a bloody mary for my friend make it extra bloody when our drinks came he poured a dollop of something from an inner pocket into my bloody mary that should help he said you could run on empty with a little of that stuff it wont refill your blood supply but while thats in your system you wont even need blood he grinned at me drink up kid i took about half of the bloody mary in one gulp and then ate the celery nepthys slapped me on the back okay i said now that were sitting down can you explain a little more of whats going on here i mean what is this place really he thought about that i think that our world is a reflection of yours or yours is a more boring reflection of ours this place is just a little of both in america things are still weird after the european conquest the natives are still here but so is everyone else the europeans mostly manifest as something like the underground society of your cities we arent quite what youd expect from reading the grimms what do you mean okay take elves he caught the bartenders eye for another shot you figure theyre some lincolngreen pretty boys who run around in the forest with bows and live forever in halls of glory right not in america here theyre the snotty rich who show up in clubs because they like the gritty ambience you have them in your world too right except its worse here because they have centuries to grow disaffected and flirt with exciting and dangerous elements of societys lowest rungs some of them actually commit to this society though theres an amazing dj whos an elf he has a real ear for it when they do decide to do something for real theyre always the best at it he downed the second shot i am glad to be out of the favortrading scene for half a minute its exhausting to talk to those people one wrong word and you find yourself cursed with infinite earwax or something so what else do you want to know nathan i dont know hey what about the nature spirits things like that i mean where do the dryads fit in a place like this if the tree isnt around the dryad isnt around its as simple as that that made me a little sad they were always my favorite part of the greek myths i read in elementary school well what about you how did you get to america my parents came over from russia just like your family my real name is a little more ethnically appropriate but we dont toss those around in this place they were spirits of a certain branch of the volga and the village based around a mill on that tributary when the russian government dammed the river my parents decided that instead of dying with the river they would stick with the people of the village theyd protected i was born here and i was lucky enough not to get attached to any particular river sure i miss having a place to settle down but its better than waiting to get dammed he took another shot of vodka shouldnt you be going light on the vodka i mean we might have a lot of work ahead of us are you kidding i can drink like a fish kid we should get going though still woozy i nodded a little walking should get the stuff into your system come on lets go as we left the bar i asked to see the rock why nepthys asked im just curious i want to see what a magic stone looks like dont worry ill be careful not to touch it he thought about it then handed me the pouch i undid the strings and let the pouch sit on my palm so that i could see the stone inside it looked like a normal river stone a gray oval with a white stripe through it as long as i looked at it it didnt reveal any magic sparkle or glow suddenly what looked like a little kid darted out of an alley and almost ran into me i almost tripped over him and the stone went flying out of the pouch nepthys tried to grab it but by reflex i caught it first immediately i felt it grow warm and knew that i had done something very stupid nathan said nepthys i think that you just did something very stupid i agree i told him the stone was as warm as human flesh now and there was a sort of glow that might have been light or just the stones soft heat i dont know then there was light a kind of rosy glow and i felt the stone slip out of my hand to float in the air the air around me seemed to still sound and light came in around the corners of my eyes do you know what this thing does i shouted hardly able to hear myself nepthys was saying something that looked like i have no idea but i couldnt hear him the light in the corners of my eyes rushed in converging on the rosy glow around the stone and for a moment i was blind then i opened my eyes again and saw a girl lying in the street there was no sign of the stone i think i understand why we got that stone from a slave shop said nepthys the girl was as soft and rosy as the stones glow and she was dressed in a white shift tied at the waist with a belt like a celtic knot her arms and legs were wrapped in white linen up to her wrists and ankles and soft white leather boots held her feet when she didnt move i knelt down and put a hand to her brow as soon as i touched her her eyes opened into mine and she grabbed my wrist i couldnt move name me she said i opened my mouth to ask for an explanation but nepthys stopped me dont name her what did you say okay the next thing that comes out of your mouth is probably what shell respond to until we figure out how to put her back i was at a loss id never named anyone before i thought back to one time when id been thinking about raising a family and remembered that id always liked the name amy nepthys looked at me incredulously you awaken a magical being of unknown power from an enchanted stone having purchased her with your own blood from a slave dealer and you name her amy amy smiled at me and let go of my arm but not before she brought my fingers to her lips and gave them one soft kiss i stood up and amy stood with me so back to our garlicky friend i suppose so said nepthys and youd better pray to whatever god you think will listen that he wont care we woke her up we walked back to the herb stand the vendor stared a little at amy his arms pausing in midair as he lit the stands little lamp but we walked right around him and up the wooden stairs when nepthys opened the little mans door he rolled over and grinned to see us but when amy walked in he blanched what he screamed you idiots you woke it up get out of my sight this instant but but sir i said are you sure shes no help to you not if you named it already you ninny and im sure that you have fools get out of my sight now unless you know how to put it back i thought as much now leave before i call the rats on you we left nepthys shook his hands at me like he wanted to wrap them around my neck you idiot he hissed do you know how much youve set us back i should say set yourself back since its your girlfriend were looking for i thought about rachel in the excitement i had forgotten why we were chasing down vampire experts youre just lucky that dvorov isnt my only contact come on were heading out he held the door for me and amy when we reached the bottom of the stairs walking outside i was shocked to see that it was already dark night comes quickly here said nepthys quietly as he came out behind me didnt i warn you okay he said as we hit the street were going to see another friend of mine first though we are getting you a hat you look ridiculous with a shaved head at a nearby stand he grabbed the first hat that would cover my head and might pass back in real boston it was a black baseball cap that read dead can dance in gold across the front amy liked it i think she still hadnt spoken since i named her so i wasnt sure he took us to a squat long building whose roof bulged up like the ribs of a gutted animal the black door opened as we came up to it and a pale man opened the door he was naked but there was nothing to hide his body was hairless and completely smooth i only say he because he didnt have a hint of femininity his eyes were white from behind him i could hear something that sounded like a remix of the cures a forest im here to see isis tell her that nepthys is here to see her the man closed his eyes a moment later he opened them again and stepped aside to let us in nepthys walked straight past him and i tried to keep up taking amys small hand so that she wouldnt lag behind i shivered as i walked past the pale mans blank eyes wondering what they were staring at amy gave my hand a squeeze nepthys lead us down a hallway that matched the buildings faade a vaulted ribbed intestine of a hallway whose black walls looked unsettlingly organic i thought that i saw one rib shift in its setting like a cat trying to scratch its back against a wall but when i turned it was still then there was a door which opened as we approached inside the space opened into a wide square chamber mirrored and so dark that it could have been any size in the center was a dais covered with white furs and a young woman surrounded by more pale men these were incontestably male nepthys said the woman slithering up across the furs to sit up as she rose her robes fell open and i realized that except for what looked like a red silk kimono she was naked naked and stunning i had an urge to cover amys eyes its been years since ive seen you please come and sit beside me and introduce your friends this man is here in search of his lover who was stolen from him in the human world said nepthys ushering us toward the woman in silk the girl is surprising he concluded and i am isis said the woman offering her hand to me i took it and dropping to one knee gave her fingers a small kiss it seemed appropriate it is an honor to meet you lady isis i said she laughed liquid alluring alarming oh precious he has lovely manners nepthys despite his poor taste in hats you may leave out the lady boy i dont wish to be reminded of how old i actually am a wave to the pale men brought a bottle of red wine and a platter of grapes now how can i help the elegantly mannered friend of my nepthys and his surprising young charge i hope i can start by offering some wine nepthys poured out wine for three of us may i have a little more of what you gave me before nepthys i asked i still feel a little woozy he poured a dollop of the clear liquid into one cup and passed it to me the wines rich scent had a touch of something chemical that i recognized from the bar but it filled my mouth and sank into my veins with reassuring warmth isis nostrils twitched slightly youve lost blood boy this story might be interesting does it have anything to do with why your head is shaved it was part of the price for this girl who was a rock at the time explained nepthys i have a feeling that she was worth the trade i added amy still holding my hand smiled she may be at that said isis gazing at her that sweet small nose and her soft lips shed kiss well i should think if gently she has good blood under her cheeks good round breasts too even though theyre small they suit her amy didnt blush and i hoped that she didnt understand what isis was saying she would have been worth it nepthys interrupted if this fool hadnt accidentally woken her up before we could give her to our contact he was going to give us valuable information for her now i understand why youre here said isis so what do you need to know you know i wouldnt come to you if i could get this information another way said nepthys apologetically mmm she replied i couldnt tell what the thoughtful look on her face meant i think that the person who stole the girl were looking for might be a vampire isis you know some way to locate the undead dont you i do describe this one to me if i know him i can find him if not youll have to bring me something to work with nepthys looked at me i thought back to seeing the man in the hollow church and described his skin his dark hair the way that light seemed to flow around him as best as i could isis set her elbows in the fur and rested her head on her hands while i spoke and tried not to stare at her full hanging breasts when i had told her all that i could remember she blinked her black lashes and said i remember him you do nepthys could hardly believe her thats amazing it is i would have sworn to you that he was dead he should be i hope that you can do a better job than the last lot she sat up running her hands along her pale round thighs all right then let me see if i can find him isis closed her eyes and lifted her hands a dark glow coalesced around her palms amy leaned forward looking amazed the glow reflected on her pink face casting a sickly pallor over her heartbeatstrong cheeks tiny drops of blood began to seep out of isis palms as her brow creased her candy lips twisted into a frown the dark glow grew stronger and larger filling the air for about a foot around her hands in her palms the droplets of blood swelled into small pools the dark glow began to flicker and isis frown of concentration became one of worry the pools in her hands grew deeper she didnt shed a bead of sweat and i didnt even see her draw a breath but the glow around her hands shuddered like a stubborn candleflame then her fingers tensed and her arms began to shake the blood in her palms still filling up began to ripple shivers swept through her body and nepthys reached out to touch her but i stopped him he glanced at me with honest concern probably the first honest moment hed shown me is she all right i didnt know her hands twitched and a drop of blood shook out splashing on the crease of her thigh and hanging to one strand of the black hair between her legs she gasped and the dark glow went out taking the blood with it in a flash of heat and red steam isis collapsed on the fur strings cut now nepthys lunged forward took her by the arms isis what happened are you hurt she shook her head rubbing her face into the white fur and murmuring something what did you say asked nepthys she rolled onto her back her arms crossed tightly over her chest for the first time she looked vulnerable when she finally spoke i had to lean close to hear her i found your vampire she said but he might know that someones looking for him hes taken great pains to keep himself hidden you should look for him at dvorovs as quickly as you can she turned to me with tired sympathy i didnt see a girl with him hurry though and you might find him before he leaves a twitch of her fingers summoned her pale servants one of these will lead you out i stood and one of her servants took me and amy to the door i looked back to see nepthys whispering something to her he stood to go but she caught his sleeve and pulled him back for a moment i turned back to the door come on amy i said hell be along soon nepthys caught up with us after a minute and walked silently to the end of the hall when we got there another pale servant was waiting for us with a box of dark stained wood he offered it to nepthys who opened the box on velvet lining a wooden hammer and two stakes mountain ash said nepthys that was very kind of her closing the box he paused beside the open door and looked back at me i really hope we find your rachel he said it looked like he was going to continue but then he walked out the door i know a quick way to dvorovs said nepthys i bet hes kicking himself now for not having a way to contact me in a few minutes we were back to the first door wed knocked on in this town and dvorov himself was greeting us the pulse from inside made the building sound like a giant heart yo my man nep you got the sucker already no but we got a tip that he might be in your club have you seen him here man youre crazy i havent had a vampire here since you and nepthys shot a wicked look at him anyway long time man thats odd do you mind if we check it out anyway i have a real feeling that hes in here somewhere dvorov glanced over his shoulder a little nervous i guess man but be quick i dont want my customers thinkin that anythings wrong you know of course well be in and out in a minute nepthys stepped in and dvorov walked us towards the dance floor so did you get anything out of the guy i sent you to dvorov asked us no he said that his research was purely academic not for hunters bummer i guess i probably shouldve known though i mean he is kinda tight about that stuff he didnt look very surprised anyway this is the dance floor man good luck something with too many arms was manning the turntables above the crowd which looked more impenetrable tonight than ever before then i saw the bar on the other side of the crowd and knew where to start looking i tried to slip along the edge of the crowd things with scales and claws kept flailing against me pressing me into the wall but i took a breath and kept moving my nose filled with a reek of thick sweat the music began to build and a strobe came on somewhere toward the center of the dance floor i heard a howl that sent bitter winds under my clothing for a second i was back with my family in russia hiding from the cold then i felt a tug on the back of my shirt and noticed that amy was following me i gathered her under my arm dvorov was somewhere behind me too negotiating delicately through his patrons just in front of me a massive thing slammed into the wall sending up a cloud of granite dust it slumped to the floor and i realized that it was a werewolf its haunches twitched in time to the music as it started to rise a man with thick scaled skin stretched across rippling muscles leapt on him i thought that my odds were better on the dance floor holding amy in my arms as we ducked between the crush of dancers i started to wonder if the chances of finding this vampire were even good enough to merit this i wasnt sure that i could survive the crush of the crowd a cold thing with countless writhing tentacles fell against me thrashing as if in the throes of a drug overdose tripping me and clutching at my limbs a woman who could have been an elf twitched and jerked beside me fingers trembling at the torn edges of her clothing then a looming shape to my right fell away and i saw him in a flash of the strobe his black eyes staring deadly into the crowd the creature blocking my vision moved back but i had seen all that i needed to see a bleeding eyeless thing shuddered and beat its arms against me but i ducked around it and toward the bar i slipped past the waving monstrosity that had blocked my view before a mountain of wet veined flesh and had almost passed through the crowd when a clawed hand grabbed my arm it was dvorov he pulled my ear down to his mouth you seen enough man he shouted yes i called back i saw him hes sitting right there at the bar dvorov tried to peek through the crowd but it had shifted again and we couldnt see a thing i dont think hes there dvorov shouted to me it must have been wishful thinking no i saw him i have to hurry too who knows how long hell stick around listen man hes not there im telling you its not even worth checking the bar i turned to keep going but he caught my arm again dont do this kid its a dumb idea even if you did find this vampire cat hed tear you apart if he got your girl shes probably dead i shook him off and squeezed between two dancing nymphs getting almost to the edge of the dance floor suddenly amy screamed i whirled around and threw up my arm just in time to knock dvorov away his eyes were glowing red and he had bared a set of fangs that could probably take my hand off the dancers near us tried to clear some space he shot back up hardly touching the ground and i kicked him back he jumped at my arm while i was still offbalance and i felt the surge of adrenaline that comes right when your body realizes that its too late to save itself a heavy thing hit my arm with a thump and knocked me back against someone with rough paws who held me up on the floor was dvorovs head separated from his body by several feet and a growing puddle of dark blood nepthys stood over him with a blue sword in his hand it flashed in the strobe where it wasnt streaked with dvorovs blood he wasnt the only one with a secret or two he said by way of explanation you spotted our boy didnt you i bet his hideout is nearby too lets hurry he wiped off the sword and sheathed it in a scabbard now belted to his hip the crowd parted for us the vampire glanced up when he saw the crowd split and his eyes flashed when he noticed us in a blink of the strobe light he was on his feet and dashing from the room come on shouted nepthys we chased after him amy keeping up valiantly behind us he bashed up a set of stairs set into the side of the wall and we chased up after him heading up a huge staircase that seemed to go up for more stories than the building could have held luckily the vampire turned off after three stories he ran down a hallway and slipped behind one of the doors but nepthys was close behind him and left it open for me i called out to amy to shut the door in case the vampire had any friends who might be trying to follow us inside was a dark room that looked like a storage space for dj equipment nepthys urged me on from the back of the room then made a turn out of sight when i came to the door at the end of the room it looked like it had been torn off its hinges i didnt imagine that nepthys had done it and it wasnt without alarm that i ran after him a black hallway opened into a space like a cathedral the vault rose into obscurity above me and a massive rose window stood ahead of me the panes looked dyed black and only a few cold beams slipped through the filter footsteps echoed through the stone chamber and the sound reflected back to me from everywhere i couldnt tell how many people were running much less where they were on the steps in front of the altar i saw pale forms and realized that they were rachel and two other women then i heard nepthys shout nathan behind you i whirled and dropped in time to see the vampire shoot over my head leaping like a panther he smashed into the pews behind me and i heard him leap across the rest of the row there was nepthys on the other side of the pews holding the wooden box in his hand he tossed it to me and i just barely had it open before i saw the vampire again turning to face me i pulled out the hammer and one of the stakes he leapt over the pews soaring like a grasshopper and drew a gleaming knife in midair i dodged but he tossed it and i held the box in front of my face the blade lodged in the wood its silver point penetrating the velvet and nearly reaching my skin my arms shook from the force of his throw then he landed heavy beside me and i scrambled to stand his first move pulled out the dagger almost wrenching my arms from their sockets as i held on to the box and the second shattered the box with a crushing punch that sent me reeling backwards i dropped the splinters and the broken second stake and raised my hammer ready to drive the ash spike into his heart behind him i saw nepthys running between the pews i braced my legs against the stone floor and he was on me i raised the stake he drew back the dagger for a slash that could doubtless open my neck from throat to spine the stake went down there was a blur and then my hands were empty and i felt pain under my jaw two points of fire opened in my throat for an instant then all went numb taste hearing and touch became a single blur and i do not know if my eyes were open my mind began to dissipate but then i felt the pain withdraw and a lifeless voice said this ones blood isnt worth drinking hands closed on my neck and i felt my spine crack i must have fallen to the floor then i could perceive nepthys sword flashing over me and i heard steel crack then bone i thought i heard rachels voice blearily calling for me then one set of footsteps began walking toward the altar i was content to let myself drift away and i had almost forgotten the body lying with broken neck on the cathedrals hard tiles when i felt a warm touch on its cheek a girls voice soft and almost recognizable spoke nathan i felt my head turn and something in my neck reconnected then my eyes opened and amy handed me the hammer and stake i stood and turned toward the altar the vampire was walking just steps ahead of me i stepped up behind him and raised my hands which almost seemed to be glowing then the stake came down into his back and one two three strikes with the hammer drove it in the vampire fell forward and blood began to flow from his mouth behind me amy was kneeling beside nepthys whose arm and rib cage were knitting back together like a wooden toy that falls apart when its string is released but draws itself together at a slight tug i pulled the vial of liquid that hed been giving me from his pocket and ran to the altar rachel her clothes torn and her face drawn looked like she might cry when she saw me i pulled her into my arms and she tried to put hers around me my fuckin hero she whispered 
 the black willow allan sat down at his desk and pulled the chair in close opening a side drawer he took out a piece of paper and his inkpot after filling his pen allan looked at his paper in the orange glow from the lantern set back in the desks righthand corner his pen cast a forbidding line of shadow slanting across the page echoing the inky darkness crouching in the edges of the lanterns struggling glow the only other illumination came from a lurid moonlight filtered through thin branches and clouds casting its bonepale glow onto the pine floorboards allan unfolded another page this one crowded with ranks of letters in tight formation from left to right the lines of letters stepped into their divisions in the shape of a storys outline the loose dry skeleton of a tale lay exposed beneath their feet awaiting tendons muscle and blushing skin allan reviewed the troops all prepared to disembark their task to form the tale of a young man returning home from life abroad to find his childhood friend a bride tobe thus upsetting the apple cart of his lifes plan clarified of course by his very time away from her he loved best although the concept was a simple one allan thought it had potential besides the public liked a good simple romance perhaps this will be more saleable he thought and began to write they gazed at each other lost in the rapture of love based so deeply within their hearts that they had never seen it before what about roger she asked knowing that the answer no longer mattered this is good he thought pausing to raise the low light of the lantern im almost done and the happy ending is just falling into place i hardly dare to think it but i may finish this story as he thought this a sinuous wind encircled the house slipping through the walls to chill him the papers and the lanterns flame trembled as the thin fingers of a great black willow rapped gently on allans window and wall like a stranger knocking on his chamber door this was no stranger however the twisted ancient thing was older than allan its branches rapping on his window since his childhood its thin drawn fingers framed the bloated moon whose eerie radiation now bathed the room directly the great jaundiced eye stared down unblinkingly at the author who gazed up through his windows tiny frame with trepidation allan recalled himself and focused once more on the incomplete page before him his pen flickered forth words dancing out from its nib in the authors eye gleamed the lanterns reflection or was it a reflection for while the lanterns spark shivered in the chill breeze this burn was steady and true as the motion of its owners pen scratching out the rhythm of the willows fingers the frenzied writing ceased at last the author leaned back with a slight sigh as if both exhausted and satisfied by his effort he held a hand to his forehead eyes closed and face flushed i did it again he thought after all that so near the end to lose control again his breath returning to its normal rhythms he dared to look at the page before him his face soft as if caught between a smile and tears he draped his loose cape over her shoulders come darling he whispered where i am to take you one need never think of those left behind they stepped together into his carriage her eyes wide with wonder as she touched it and felt conveyed as if through her skin the unearthly nature of the rails and reins the wheelspokes they took their seats within the car and his driver set the horses trotting for a few yards they kicked up dust along the roadway then they raised their hooves and took to the air she gaped afraid but knowing that no harm would come to her by his hand the new england woods disappeared even the greatest pines shrinking to insignificance as they mounted the sky above them the milky way drew near as if the stars themselves could be reached a magnificent glow infused the carriage as they merged with the skys glory allan crushed the page in his hand and hurled it at the window damn you he cried will you never leave me be shall i never finish a story in peace he pounded his desk in vain cursing the foul muse that drove him the next day allan sat on a florally patterned chair in a wellfurnished parlor taking a measured sip of white wine from his crystal glass he glanced at his host a cultured man dressed in a light suit of the current fashion and wearing his pale hair with a heavy set of sideburns who passed him a silver tray cucumber sandwich allan took a sandwich between his fingers thank you arthur arthur replaced the tray onto the lacquered cherry table that stood in the center of his ordered chamber in a manner delicately balanced between somber and genial he refilled their glasses how is the writing these days my dear mr clemm perfectly dreadful my dear mr mason allan sighed i had a perfect story in my pages my hero returned home and reclaimed his love i nearly had it tied together before before before that blasted impulse came over me and i started writing like edgar poe though the most recent was not so morbid as my many others thank heaven arthurs face assumed a longsuffering aspect of authoritative exasperation im not familiar with mr poes works but i assume youre referring to your unhealthy penchant for the fantastic its far from a penchant arthur this is more like a compulsion a beast that lies waiting in the dark for the perfect moment then leaps and takes ahold of me screaming out through my quill how perfectly awful arthur grimaced at the vivid description im sure you know that you must curb this behavior if you wish to produce any writing fit for public consumption i know allan replied but how am i to do that you know i do not wish to make my stories thus but it is my nemesis confronting me anew at every turn arthur raised a critical brow perhaps you could make some headway if you denied your darker side the outlet of the colorful metaphors you so enjoy every action you take to deny it nourishment will bring you closer to your goal and believe me allan you must take every opportunity to quash this uncivilized obsession if you intend to publish there simply is no audience for fairy tales no literate audience at least it is true allan admitted fidgeting with his cufflinks that i would not dream of submitting one of these corruptions of literature to any publisher ive even tried rewriting the corrupted sections but once my characters have gone down that road nothing can recall their former life my prodigal inkblooded children simply lose their vitality when forced along the proper road arthur sighed and sipped his wine if only you would restrain this morbid impulse of yours you might write something really worth reading its hard enough listening to your wild speech without seeing it appear in the refined world of print like a surly foreigner among a genteel crowd allan hung his head holding his wine with both hands between his arched knees his hair was slightly unkempt after his sleepless night and his clothing had a rumpled look as if by mere proximity it had taken on the aspect of his weariness he scratched the back of his darkhaloed head and blinked bleary eyes i would drive it out he said softly but i fear for what would remain perhaps you require a rest from writing suggested arthur you might find that some time in an honest occupation would ground you somewhat improve your disposition perhaps it would allan replied rising and vainly straightening his suit i shall consider it in the meantime however i must be off you have been a gracious host as always arthur rose and shook his hand so dear a friend is always welcome to my counsel and my home he said i hope soon to see you in better sorts they parted and allan made his way pensively from arthurs gate he walked the wheelruts hands in his pockets and unshined shoes collecting dust some quartermile from arthurs gate he halted confronted by a halloo nathan he called out to the empty road the reply came from above him and allan turned to see his friend reclining in the fork of a great tree i had a hunch youd be at arthurs today said nathan so i thought id wait here for you nathans lanky frame dressed in a loose tan jacket fit into the branch like an elegant skeleton his hair fell loosely across a face that seemed always to have a knowing smirk hidden just beneath its surface infusing his body with a rakish energy so allan said nathan unfolding and lowering his legs to the roadside how goes life for the quintessential american author i wouldnt know replied allan dryly before continuing in another tone entirely i destroyed another story last night nathan leaning against his tree nathan shook his head you mean finished another story yes it is finished ended never again shall it see the rosyfingered dawn nathan youve read these abominations of mine you know just as well as i that they have no future no potential at best they are faery tales at worst expeditions into macabre realms no healthy mind need ever see so instead you would write what something saleable something worth reading worth writing i want to write as others do a tale set in our real world of characters who might live therein not citizens of some airy demesne beyond the stars why is that more desirable than what you write today people will read such stories they are worth publishing if you never finish such stories how can they be worth publishing that is precisely why i must excise this malignant instinct why do you write why to earn a living i suppose why do you ask you choose to write rather than become a fisherman or a carpenter though you face such difficulty why is that i suppose it is because i enjoy my craft i would not be happy thus separated from it so at its heart then your writing as opposed to working otherwise is for yourself yes i suppose one could see it thus but really nathan your queer habits of conversation have reached a new level ignoring the statement nathan continued your writing is for you allan not for the publishers or some imagined audience since you seem unable to write normally why not embrace your tales as they are leave behind the one unhappiness in the art you admit is a source of pleasure your stories strike a chord with the deepest most ancient stories of mankind the tales basic to humanity tell them and they will create an audience you need not pander to what you imagine their wants are speak and they shall listen allan crouched over his desk once more pen in hand and mind blank he contemplated a story an outline he had laboriously constructed some time ago he had filled his pen and raised it the nib descending towards the paper before the sound came the gentle persistent tapping of the gnarled primeval willow touching the window with long insistent fingers his eyes awoke with a passionate determined flame though the only light came from the glutted moon allan filled page after page the words escaping from his mind onto the paper where before they had marched in regiments practiced in ranks and followed their leaders commands the words now escaped in their true forms unhindered by any stricture he continued long into the night until the eldritch orb had sunk into the waiting hands of the willow raised perpetually skyward arthur looked up from the results of a nights frenzied labors and looked allan in the eye what is this he queried indicating the pages he held in his left hand i decided that since i wasnt having much success with more traditional stories i might see what sort of work i produced if i let my imagination go freely allan replied somewhat less selfassured than he had been the previous night what in gds name could have possessed you to do such a thing cried arthur nearly raising his voice after all i said the day before why have you abandoned centuries of literary progress for some selfindulgent fantasy he shook the papers at allan raising them like a belt above the head of a disobedient son this is nothing but a glorified grimms tale a miscarried child of stoker a creation less fit to be published than to be told around an open fire at the hovel of some peasant he spoke the last word with such heavy intonation that allan shrank back before the physical wave of sound emanating from arthurs throat do you hate the modern system of literature do you personally despise the works the enlightenment or the progress made since shakespeare for a moment allan could hardly do more than shake his head no of course not i then why arthur barreled on do you disregard them all and return to this superstitious babble this morbid paganistic drivel why do you disregard my warnings my careful advice given in the best of friendship and designed only to save you from sinking into this very type of corruption this literary debauchery he glared at allan eyes impaling him and demanding a response could you write decent tales with that willow at your window allan cried out at last stepping forward and casting his arms open confronting arthur with this demanding pleading interrogation its twigs rap constantly against the wall the wind always demanding my attention how could any writer accommodate the edicts of popular literature with the very forces of nature knocking upon his door arthur looked down his nose at the distraught author viewing his complaint with pure disdain scantily concealed by the veneer of politeness that animated the construct that was arthur mason a tree a tree forced you to write this my dear mr clemm i must admit this seems farfetched even by your standards even your nathan might have difficulty believing you you dont know what this is like said allan shaking his head nathan would understand completely even as he said it allan prayed that his statement was true very well said arthur then take your story to that hedonist and let him defend you when no civilized publisher will approach you if you insist on abandoning me i shall not hold you with that he tossed the papers at allan and left the room stunned allan slowly gathered up the pages and placed them in order he then turned and left through the door opposite that arthur had taken making his way past his hosts doorman without assistance and setting off on foot towards nathans residence several miles away nathan read the package of words in silence his only motions the steady progress of his eyes and occasional replacement of pages allan sat nervously across from him in a chair nathan had probably upholstered himself a patchwork design of fabric containing easily more stuffing than any other furniture item of the period at long last nathan reached the end and set down his reading on the table between them allan leaned forward unconsciously its the best story youve ever written allan exhaled and leaned back into the chair his face relaxing in imitation of his thoughts so he asked you dont think its a waste of ink and paper a futile expedition into morbidity or literary debauchery heavens no said nathan aghast this is one of the strongest works ive read in ages it speaks to the deepest storytellers instinct within us all yet is entirely original my dear friend you have done it oh they may rail against you at first they may decry you as a heathen or a literary savage but while those in power say such things others will read your tales and see their true worth believe me when i say that you will be read a century from now allan though dubious as to that possibility felt some temptation from the compliment mainly it granted him the encouragement he still needed nathan promised to show the story to a printer he knew and allan left it with him then walked home under the spreading maples with a smile lingering on his face he felt now that perhaps nathan was right although the man was somewhat peculiar he had both an unimpeachable honesty and a certain propensity for insight certainly it was undeniable that the stories had an originality to them his minds strangest fruit had ripened at last and he found the taste less bitter than expected these thoughts and others like them filled his head as he walked the long road home it was evening and the sky burned orange in the west when he neared home at last passionate fiery colors filled the western sky before him though the sun itself had reached the trees and a few dark clouds circled overhead as allan drew closer he distinguished a new cloud a pillar rising directly ahead a road of smoke ascended in the west its source hidden by the very hillock that concealed his house from the traveler until one had nearly reached its door allans thoughts fled as one scattering on the breeze that scattered the warning plume he ran the last distance crested the hill puffing to reveal arthur below walking to the carriage parked before allans house as two laborers wrapped a great saw in oilcloths and loaded it onto the vehicles roof arthur paused in the door looking up at allan for a moment then he turned and shut the door behind him the driver snapped the reins and set the horses on as they trotted forth allans eyes remained trapped by the carriage following it up the hillock and past himself the heavy curtains had been drawn across its windows he watched as the carriage drew still more distant the horses hooves still kicking up dust along the roadway when they had gone he remained stunned until the scent of woodsmoke recalled him to himself he turned to regard the pillar still rising behind his house and ran to see what had been done rounding the corner he saw a great bonfire a mass of flaming wood stood before him heat singeing him and sparks flying too close to his house it was a moment before he realized what else had changed near the wall beneath his window was a stump with black and ancient bark in a thoughtless panic allan flew to the stream that ran by his house and began frantically throwing handfuls of water onto the pyre his thoughts were not of the acts futility nor even of the nights spent tormented by the twisted thing instead all that filled his mind was the trees constant presence in his life growing with him and beside him its persistent reminders that he had higher truer things to write the simple beauty of the great black tree for its own sake his handfuls could do nothing to quench the hewn burning logs but when the night sky grew dark above him and the fire dwindled to black ashes tears threatened to spill forth and extinguish the final embers but he did not weep instead he bethought himself of the loss of the tree considered also arthurs motivation and whether some good might not come of this after all leaving the circle of ashes he stood and turned towards the woods in which it was his habit to walk when in a pensive mood he stepped slowly beneath the branches a gust of wind stirring up the ashes behind him in a great swirling eddy a burning brand that rose up and dispersed on the winds as though it were the willows last breath allan wandered beneath the trees for a time thoughts drifting through his mind like great banks of fog strangely beautiful but impossible to penetrate he considered arthurs intervention considered that it might be better to accept the fog and continue as his lifelong friend had suggested to write stories that others would read for after all what purpose writing if not to be read and without that torturous willow he might be free to write whatever he saw fit indeed if he still could not he could at any time follow arthurs advice and seek a profession more grounded in reality perhaps that would be more healthy for his mind he found himself along the bank of a low wide stream and allowed himself to follow its current as it turned to the deeper woods elder giants rose above him a beech smooth bark a graygreen pennant hoisted on a slope and standing out between the dark cracked trunks of the nearer trees great pines a few magnificent specimens still bearing the threestroke symbol of the british king a towering black birch leaves impossibly high above him as the stream wound its way through the largest pines grown so great as to eclipse that feature of the landscape they had once crowded about for sweet water as saplings allan continued slowing his pace to climb across the toes of the slumbering giants there was hardly enough room for his slim frame between the trunks that overshadowed any fleeting mortal trespass emerging from between the antediluvian trunks allan set his feet softly down onto the carpet of needles and stopped before him roots imbibing the sweet water of the stream grew a stand of black willows fallen trunks lay rotting across the rivulet the living elders oversaw the grove while younger trees still small and not yet as knotted and gnarled as their forefathers sprang up where branches reached the ground though the elders trunks fell and died their children first roots grown from the very branches that now lay dead continued unabated a continuous line from the most ancient of their ancestors allan stumbled forward jaw slightly slack until his outstretched hands encountered the rough bark of a twisted threetrunked willow whose waists were each larger than allan himself collapsing at its base allan wrapped his arms around the stoic tree and let forth a moan a cry of purest agony that escaped him as the first tears seeped from the corners of his eyes and slid down his cheeks falling to the ground and seeping though the fallen leaves and needles to join the water of the stream flowing through the ground beneath them

remember papas stopbox a teal blue tiempo capturado that mama brought home for his birthday it was huge and inefficient and she should never have spent so many pesos on a toy but papa would not let her return it he used it to preserve baby tomatoes cucumbers and strawberries in translucent cubes that he stored in the pantry for springtime meals in the middle of winter mama kept her mink jacket a family handmedown safe from time in a stopbox and lent the capturador to my uncle for his stamp collection sometimes they would let us little ones to seal a treasured toy or a last piece of birthday cake until we begged them for its release usually a few hours after enclosing it when my father died a year after my mother my sisters and i cleaned out their apartment we found our baby shoes protected in stopboxes i took mine home where they sat above my computer while i worked on my first play one night when i did not believe love had ever existed for anyone i used my own capturador a sleek titanium sanyo tardar ahora to undo the stopbox bringing my face close to the shoes i breathed deeply of air that my parents had trapped while closing up that symbol of their love for me the instant would have been improved had my baby shoes been cleaned before they were encased but as soon as i coughed i laughed and i did not try to kill myself that night let me begin again i like life on the resort worlds always have and after the upcoming mindwipe always will last year i rented a small house on vega iv a sea world all islands and reefs and archipelagos turquoise waters and aquamarine skies sunrises like symphonies and sunsets like stars gone supernova theres only one city called nuevo acapulco in la enciclopedia del empirio de la humanidad its napulco to the locals the napulcans are mostly emigrants from polaris ii the only difference between them and their carribbean ancestors is that the ancestors fleeced noram tourists now the napulcans profit from their hispanic siblings i dont mean to sound cynical i suppose i wish to show that im still capable of a certain authorial distance a semblance of dispassionate observation the following events may indicate otherwise in fine tourist tradition most homes on vega iv are named mine was the sleeping flamingo and its outer walls were coral pink were they moodsensitive they would have changed as i first viewed them the rental agent an attractive napulcan named tasha cortez was not moodsensitive either she said its beautiful isnt it seor flynn my instinct was to gesture curtly with a cupped hand that she lift the wind boat and take me elsewhere but she was young and attractive as i have said and may say again and eager and so happy to be assisting the infamous bernardo flynn that i merely raised an eyebrow in mild scepticism and then because a playwright cannot resist a promising line i said your sleeping flamingo should be put to sleep to say her face fell would do a disservice to tasha and to literature allow me my selfindulgences as you would those of a dying man when i convince my mindsmith to permit the wipe there will be another bernardo flynn one who knows no more of tasha cortez or vega iv than he reads here her brows drew together creasing the lovely caramelcolored skin around her eyes and showing the pattern for an old womans wrinkles on her forehead her lower lip a trifle too narrow for her face perhaps her only physical flaw thrust forward slightly as she started to speak she caught herself slid her jaw infinitesimally back into place and said you dont like it i laughed what could i do i clapped her shoulder to show i was not laughing at her like it i hate it despise it abhor it its gaudy graceless pretentious that house is an affront to taste and intelligence i should buy it to raze it but i am not so kindhearted i might however rent it i think she only heard the last words of my speech you will it amuses me show me around and then i shall decide of course seor flynn and stop calling me seor not even los mundos is so polite call me bernardo if you wish i beg you change the color of the walls at the very least but of course the house walls shifted from pink to lavender i stared hows that i looked at her worse i nodded i would not have thought it possible she frowned it is rather ugly thoroughly ugly i corrected with smile obscenely ugly said she smiling too no i pointed it has no tower i can fix that she reached for another dial on the house controls dont you dare her wrist when i grabbed it was smooth and strong and warm in my fingers ill take it exactly as it is you will i must god knows what you might do to it next reluctantly i released her hand the interior of the flamingo was a welcome surprise cloudwood had been used in a mediterranean manner making the house seem primitive and civilized at the same time the kitchen and baths had every convenience that i desired from the living room the view of the beach struck me with such intensity that tasha asked if i felt ill all i could say was no im in love we both thought i referred to the vista its strange how one can write delightedly of the happier moments of life forgetting the things that one would forget by remembering fully the things one would remember and suddenly the forgotten in revenge rears up to savage the unwary so it was as i wrote the preceding my heart convulsed and i left this manuscript for a threeday spree apparently i was so successful that it lasted a week and a half not bad for an eightythreeyearold even for one who has his rejuve every month and if i can brag and digress so easily this must not be painful enough to merit a mindwipe yes no i abandoned these notes to my future self to have the wipe done immediately thinking that bernardo flynn should receive such services when he needed them even should the need arise at the third hour after midnight my mindsmith is not so understanding she says i am emotionally a child to which i reply of course why else would i come to you this logic does not soothe her she says i must wait three weeks three such is the law i say i do not care about law i care about service and she should care about money enough i went on a spree and it must have been a good one i hope the wipe is as successful with my time on vega iv as my spree was with my time here i dimly remember three bedpartners who were probably human and one that i hope was delirium i will not answer the phone for a week no matter whose face appears on it i keep evading the issue but which issue the issue of why i am evading the issue or the issue itself to deal with the first it hurts to remember if i am capable of love i loved tasha cortez if i am not i had the perfect mirror for my narcissism as for the issue itself im no longer sure what i want to record the playwright in me wants every scene of our time together the editor says no only those that are relevant the sufferer says no only those which cause no pain and the artist says no only those which cause the most pain for those would be the truest memories so i shall soothe my quarreling selves with a compromise i will not talk of the first time tasha and i tried any act of sex or sport together i can remember similar things with others tashas witchery lay in making old acts new is that love probably not but it is something marvelous and rare which is surely a sign of love if my love for her was the only important thing i would leave a holo of her with a note dear future this is tasha cortez you loved her with warmest regards your past enough tasha and i walked through the sleeping flamingo together and i decided to buy it then this is not easy i stand up i walk around i pretend someone makes a vid about a writer and i must enact every cliche i cannot decide whats important but i have learned something writing trivializes the tasha who was is not the tasha in this file the tasha in this file is not even the tasha i loved and thought i knew the tasha in this file would walk through a net show in half an hour including commercials and just before an ad for figueros flash diapers keeps baby driest she tasha is not the whole of what happened on vega iv i must also write about emiliano gabriel malaquez future self you know our style well enough to tell that time has passed between the last sentence and this not another spree at least not like the other i have been rereading all our favorite books but neither of us care to dwell on such boring subjects do we i want to pick up with tasha and me walking about the sleeping flamingo and then for the sake of literary convenience to say that from a corner of the yard i saw a neighboring house and the sight filled me with darkest forebodings but the truth is that tasha pointed it out from the one place where it could barely be seen and i only felt envy that it had been designed by someone with understated good taste who lives there i asked no one tasha replied truth is always more boring than fiction for malaquez did not move into dreams end until four or five months after i we how does one speak to ones future self occupied the flamingo i do not plan to write a book this narrative must move more quickly tasha and i became lovers that evening after a good dinner of paella at her apartment i made some small joke afterward about approving of her firms business incentives and she cried consoling her i began to suspect i loved her i moved into the flamingo the next day and she gave up her apartment three weeks later to join me it was the sort of romance that happens so rarely that most people believe it does not happen at all the sort of romance that sustains the hopeless billions who regularly watch a wandering star called love which is to say you and me future self who was tasha cortez she was a twentyfouryearold terran standard napulcan who left university training in hydroponics to work for her aunts real estate firm her family said she did it to support her father who was dying of a particularly painful degenerative disease tasha said she woke up one morning convinced that if she spent another day studying vegetables she would become one she did not like my plays i had impressed her because i was famous and amusing and not as i had hoped because i was a great artist that bothered yes and intrigued me until i realized that she was bored by most plays movies and vid she did not like being a spectator i often told her that she should have a biocheck to see if she suffered from some metabolic imbalance i often told her too many things search emiliano malaquez and youll find hes a master of the captured moment school of sculpture even the terran times has only praise for his work to compare his pieces to those of others is to compare mannequins to living models he accents the illusion of reality i paraphrase his entry in la enciclopedia humanica by doing lifesize scenes in the full round never the easier frontal or threequarters view moreover he never did portraits of famous people his works were therefore the reality and could never be compared to it as is typical of his school his pieces are sealed in stopboxes the shimmer of light on their surfaces always reminds us that were looking at an instant snatched from under the hooves of time they say the cubes will outlast planets and suns that when the universe dies the works of malaquez and his followers will be the last things seen in the final wink of gods eye yes self i am also bothered that this observation ignores halfeaten cheese sandwiches incomplete insect collections and locks of infants hair forgotten in closets basements and warehouses you see the inspiration for my latest play captured moments the mindwipe will take its creation from my future self but time too often does that without aid the plays second act concludes with the last fight between tasha and me i have disguised us in the play and deleted one brief melodramatic interchange now i will mention it in case iyou decide to restore it shortly before she left tasha said you steal from life for art bernardo youll impoverish yourself i only snarled at her and my story leaps ahead of itself let me retreat and retrench one night during napulcos mild winter tasha returned to the flamingo saying nardo nardo guess what my mind was on other things you wish to become pregnant i suppose i could assist a friend purely for the sake of the race of course ever the altruist still if i do decide we could practice later i said youve been chosen to succeed the emperor what my guess she batted at my nose like a cat silly nardo then i give up emil malaquez is buying the house up the hill oh you dont know who he is well nardo one of the many things i liked about her was that she often thought me shockingly ignorant thats uh i am never so quickwitted in person as i am on the page especially when someone thinks me shockingly ignorant you know the sculptor hes had shows in brazil and new madrid and everywhere he may be more famous than you imagine that i remembered an article in the medusa and a photo of a work in which 100peso notes fell like confetti onto a small undersider sexlessly young in grimy oversized clothing the childs face was a warground for wonder and mistrust imprisoned light from forgotten streetlamps snagged itself on metal threads in the fluttering pesos the stars themselves might have fallen on the undersider and the event would have been no less strange no less miraculous a great artist will grace this world then nardo she was never tolerant of my ego well whats this morefamousthanme person like i didnt meet him jealous old one too bad if i thought he could free me from you hah she wrapped her arms around my stomach youll never be free of me old man the next evening she arrived with a stack of glistening stopboxes containing sushi sashimi oysters in their shells and terran vegetables fresh plucked from their hydroponic beds wondering about the reason for her extravagance i asked how work had gone that day emil came in hes taking dreams end emil youve no memory left old one emil malaquez ah you did that to test my affections what calling him by his first name i did that in a comedy oncenights with karl and groucho it was before your time oh the critics liked it im glad a moment later thats not why i called him emil no no we lunched together hes nice oh it wasnt like that youre free of course still it wasnt like that you think i sleep with every famous person i meet as you may have guessed we had talked about such things i do not claim ours was a perfect affair only a wonderful one tasha do you no good i invited him to dinner tomorrow oh hell be our neighbor you say were becoming too insular that we need to socialize ive socialized for sixtythree years nardo yes how should i reply her voice had grown quiet and i began to feel some guilt i had it is true told her that we needed other company than our own i said this from years of learning that romances consume themselves without other fuel but knowing this did not mean i wanted it i said truthfully it was the statement of a younger and crueler man than i she screamed i havent socialized with terras elite for most of my life i havent socialized with hardly anyone for hardly any of my life and i invite a neighbor one nice lonely man im sorry who took me to what im sorry truly oh she studied me as a suspicious puppy might then said im sorry too i suppose i sound like im bragging when i talk of the things im tired of only because you are she smiled i had to grin so i did true he may come to dinner if you wish he may be dinner i love you and i you months earlier we might have sought a bed a couch or a comfortable chair at this point instead i asked is he handsome youre jealous a tiny bit extremely content yourself old one hes four inches shorter than i his nose is big and broken and this is cosmetic hes not that ugly i think theyre his natural features interesting you could write a play about someone like him perhaps i think his face is his form of vanity its the reverse of you with those ridiculous stomach muscles old men should be fat is emil yes i am jealous ill eat two dinners tonight five deserts she giggled and then we did make love ive been thinking about the mindwipe now two days away who said that those who forget the past are doomed to repeat it i fear that may be true for me add this to the reasons i write now to remember something perhaps even to learn emil malaquez arrived after sundown carrying a small package wrapped in what looked like real paper his evening dress was formal expensive and slightly stained as that of all forgetful artists should be he was a jovial man with an easy laugh and even uglier than tasha had suggested i liked him immediately seor malaquez please call me emil you must be bernardo tashas told me much about you all of it outrageous praise all of it ah she is wonderfully perceptive he raised an eyebrow then guffawed has she said as much about me she thinks you are a genius do come in thank you stepping into the living room he said a beautiful house im glad you came after dark tasha by accident or design had found an innocently erotic posture on the couch where she lay with a book of mduvian prints emil she leapt up i did not expect you so early on time its unforgiveable but youre forgiven she nodded at the package whats that for your kindness in inviting a stranger into your home he held it out and with a delighted oh tasha snatched it from him to rip away the paper i stopped writing and only the thought that i might miss the mindwipe kept me from another spree i went walking but after napulco rio seems no fit abode for a creature of flesh i walked from this hotel to the old city past the end of the slidewalks and softwalks to the hard cracked pavement of city park but undersiders left me alone perhaps they recognized a fellow ghost so i returned and slept and now the mindwipe is thirteen hours away the side of malaquezs parcel gave way to reveal a greenmunk caught in a sheen of solid air bits of leaf mold flew from under his feet as he ran to greet a friend or a bringer of food tasha oohed in awe i said frodos been visiting you eh malaquez said your pet hardly he lives around here somewhere i suppose he was attracted to the commotion up the hill ah malaquez said why frodo tasha said a little fellow with big furry feet what else could he be called she handed the sculpture to me i almost dropped it i expected it to weigh no more than a holo heavy i said as if he might not have known he laughed my last piece was of four old undersiders crouched around a trash fire be glad someone didnt toss that to you he spoke of his art with the enthusiasm of a sevenyearold um i should wait to importune you but he grinned shyly a confession and then a request and then you must forgive me for being so forward its not easy for me to ask a favor relax i said its easy for me to turn one down he glanced at me and decided i was joking the surprising thing is that i was good my last show was glorious tasha said was kindly received he said but an artist who would stay first among his fellows can tell when he begins to fail oh i hoped no one would bring up my last three plays i must change my subject matter no more urchins dopers vagrants or whores i want to do more traditional portraits he spoke quickly prepared to be rejected would you permit me to do one of you i would pay never i said ah he shrugged lightly nardo tasha said its an honor of course i said thats why i cannot take payment oh oh thank you malaquez turned to tasha and you as well perhaps the two of you together her eyes became circles at the idea of being as she undoubtedly thought it immortalized by emil malaquez catching herself she said casually oh and then she smiled laughed loudly at herself in the way that always made me think how much i loved her and said my god yes yes yes for a perfect moment emil and tasha and i were one entity laughing until our lungs hurt this is torture i had not considered that i might not write to learn but to punish myself let me abuse the playwright and dismiss the penultimate scene in a few sentences after giving emil full rights to a sculpture of tasha and me we had a good dinner of curried clam chowder lobsters boiled on terra and unstopped still steaming on napulco and cinnamon custard for desert then we went out for a late swim i had drunk too much i confess though we all had somehow tasha and i began to argue the worth of solevgrad jazz as inconsequential a topic as i can imagine she had studied it in school so she thought herself as an expert i once had a neighbor who played it constantly loudly and badly so i thought i knew it better malaquez tried to mediate but i saw him as siding with tasha so i think did she the subject shifted from music to tashas obsession with fame undoubtedly by a leap that i made she had no choice but to follow i do not remember any of this well just now nor do i care to those who are truly curious may look at the last act of captured moments i remember suggesting with characteristic tact that she add emil to her small list of major accomplishments malaquez glanced away embarrassed tasha looked at me as if to say i will she said i feel sorry for you nardo ill see emil home yes i said do that and did not care what she did or why emil asked youre all right i muttered something he must have interpreted as assent they both walked up to emils home while i watched the scarlet moonlight ripple on distant waves disgusted with tasha but more disgusted with myself i finally realized she would not return that night and went into the sleeping flamingo to drink myself to sleep she had not come home when i woke in midmorning i waited and drank a glass of morningafter and three cups of coffee and wondered whether our affair could survive the events of the night and whether i wanted it to perhaps i should have invited emil to stay but even then i knew that sex was not the problem between tasha and me the problem was that i have trouble distinguishing between compromise and capitulation between symbols and substance shortly before noon i climbed the sandy path to dreams end rehearsing my apology slowing only to pluck burrs from between my sandals and my feet malaquez answered the door in bloodred pajamas and a black silk robe sixty years ago in a similar situation i had broken my knuckles on someones face i merely said is tasha here he pursed his lips slightly then nodded yes may i see her when he hesitated i said last night was my fault i hold it against neither of you please let me talk to her i please he looked me and at last said very well we walked through his house in silence it was as attractive and as impersonal as a decorator could arrange for tenants of unknown taste a tall narrow stopbox stood in the center of one room sand trickled forever downward while beads of water splashed across the sands path if that was malaquezs work it was a very minor effort but then i was in no mood to consider art i only wanted to despise the man who had slept with my lover that was easier than despising myself he paused before a bedroom door i should go in first to prepare her i smiled she handles surprise surprisingly well what would it hurt true go ahead tell her i shrugged tell her i love her he studied me then said im sorry things happened this way bernardo i didnt anticipate last night im very good at making things happen this way but if tasha will forgive me he nodded repeated i am sorry then slipped into the next room i waited in the dark carpeted hall a warm breeze came from silent vents above me i heard no voices until malaquez said enter i blinked when i opened the door sunlight filled malaquezs bedroom tasha lay sprawled nude on a rumpled bed her skin seemed as smooth and as polished as the beds teak frame she was looking slightly to my left smiling with trust and satisfaction like one sexually content malaquez stood near her pointing something at my chest though the morning sun shone fully on both of them it shimmered around tasha the part of my mind that remembered four months in noram during the great cleaning sent me rolling across the floor malaquez was not prepared for me to react so quickly or perhaps he waited too long for an expression i would not have a gesture i would not make a poignant moment of repentence wonder despair or love had he been faster he could have had rage i threw a chair at him as he fell i scrambled onto him my knees pinning his arms my fingers probing his neck i shouted where is she tell me or ill kill he began to cry she left earlier this morning her clothes lay by the cube enclosing the bed i hit him with the back of my hand tell me malaquez she wanted to be famous she did now she will be he seemed to expect me to understand where i demanded squeezing his throat until he began jerking his head madly at the sculpture i stared at the naked tasha most of his story i have pieced together since but i understood enough as i knelt on his chest with my hands tight on his fleshy throat he had made his name with a home capturador he began with small animals and moved on to derelicts and undersiders people who would never be missed now he had thought to use vacationers like tasha and me and when someone came looking he would say we had gone islandhopping in our windboat our boat would disappear into the ocean to be found or not as the wind and tides chose his story would stand in either case i wanted him to tell me more but he babbled begging me to forgive him to understand i did not listen i took the capturador a matte black tiempo capturado from his grip and studied it not really thinking about it or malaquez or tasha i think i was wondering what it meant to say that a thing was art so we accepted it as art or perhaps i was thinking about the things that humanity made that would outlive our species but i was probably only looking at my reflection in the capturadors lens had he said then that i should use it on myself i might have that moment passed i looked at malaquez his eyes opened wider while we watched each other his lips contorted as if they had lost their ability to shape sound i turned to touch the cube that was tashas crypt she smiled in trust or pleasure or pride an erotic mona lisa who would smile forever and i could never know why the controls of the capturador were more complex than those of a kitchen model but i recognized the unstop tab i could free tasha if i did one of three things would happen most likely she would be meat there is a reason why stopboxes are most often used in kitchens less likely she would live the rest of her days with a mind as free of worry as a slugs and the tiniest chance of all she would blink as if i had just materialized in emils bedroom and then she would laugh and tell me that she was going to be immortal as i put my hand on the impervious surface of tashas stopbox i heard malaquez run for the door it is strange to know that we can do acts of unrepayable kindness to those we should hate know this my future self thanks to us emil malaquezs name will live as long as his masterpiece a selfportrait anguish endures and tasha i could say that i did not dare to take responsibility for her fate i could say that i chose out of consideration for her desire for fame some critics already say waking with tasha is malaquezs finest work if science finds a way to safely free the subjects of emils art perhaps the i who reads this file will know that my decision is wise but i cannot stop thinking that i was never afraid of losing tasha to brain damage or death my fear is that she would live and i would learn that i had lost her long before emil malaquez translated her into a thing that can be kept admired and loved for in my way i have done the same thing i am ready for the mindwipe now 
 hotel california fact sound is a vibration sound travels as a mechanical wave through a medium and in space there is no medium so when my shuttle malfunctioned and the airlocks didnt keep the air in i heard nothing after the first whoosh of the air being sucked away there was lightning but no thunder eyes bulging in panic but no screams quiet and peaceful right such a relief to never again hear my crewmate jesse natter about his girl back on earth and that allexpensespaid vacationfortwo she won last time he was on leave i swore if i ever had to see a photo of him in a skimpy bathing suit again giving the camera a cheesy thumbsup from a lounge chair on one of those white sandy beaches id kiss a monkey metaphorically of course fact if before all the air is sucked out of the ship a person is so lucky to have stuffed him or herself into a space suit that person has less than twentyfour hours to live this is more than the person would have sans space suit me i found a space suit but it was statistically unlikely that i and whomever else has followed suit pun intended would manage to repair our ship before the lessthantwentyfour hours are up yes studies have been done so twentyfour hours give or take about the time i was composing my last words in my head trying not to think too much about what suffocating felt like thats when i heard a bell my first thought i was going crazy twentyfour hours of silence vacuum remember was i hallucinating noises now i heard it again it was a fine bell reminiscent of ancient stone churches and the towering cathedrals id seen in documentaries and accompanying the bell i saw a light now there were two things here that made ridiculously small amounts of sense first the whole inavacuum whysthereabell thing second i was floating in the dark remnants of my broken ship and any conceivable light sources were not within view starlight is a distinctly different color and significantly less bright these signals were the heralds of my saviors the first words they said to me meant nothing i wasnt listening i didnt care i was going to live i was going to keep breathing next to those nothing else mattered the recycled air tasted sweet in my mouth and all thoughts that crossed my mind were cheap metaphors about lifegiving substances and how breathing was like sex only better i reserved the right to revise this opinion later when i was done mentally exclaiming over my impossible rescue i looked around the ship it was odd and old either so outdated or so heavily modified that i couldnt tell what make it was and somehow the crew standing around me fit the same description a singularly atypical amalgamation of folk and me i guess i was one more piece in their puzzle i was one more scrap to weld onto the rest one more stranded survivor who was found i was now one of them this story its our story the survivors of the unfortunate accidents the catastrophic malfunctions the fateful crashes this is us floating alone each of us facing the silence of the vacuum we were found once found we can never be lost this is our hotel california we can never leave so im on a ship now you do this a lot a woman introduced as tiffany and neither tall nor beautiful shrugged now and then what about my crewmates why didnt you save them as much as jesse had irritated me i didnt like the picture my brain drew of him floating in his grave body swollen and bloated who would tell his girl how he had died couldnt said the captain jefferson he called himself cleanshaven and smart a picture of the perfect entrepreneur an opportunist and a businessman that was jefferson were selective about our passengers he continued you fit the bill they didnt tiffany she looked at the captain grinned and flipped her greasy brown locks over her shoulder she turned to me come on she said before i could say anything else lets get you settled in no time for questions no time for answers the ship had all the usual accoutrements artificial gravity tastefully painted walls sound dampeners to keep the noise of the engines from driving the crew batshit insane recycled air systems and a few lessusual lush carpeting lighting that was decorative as well as functional spacious corridors the occasional painting hung on the wall generic landscapes and portraits of old people no one has ever met primarily glimpses of elegant rooms down the branching hallways music voices the aroma of real food this was heaven no seventytwo virgins but it would do where are we going i asked tiffany looked back to your quarters its not far youre not going to get blisters no i meant wheres the ship going whats our destination tiffany she stopped walking she gave me a look pitying and a little pleased that she got to be the one to share the news honey she said youre going to be delighted destination everywhere destination nowhere this was hell i died in those last moments suffocating on my own exhaled breath and this this was my reward fact the speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees celsius or sixtyeight degrees fahrenheit is three hundred and fortythree meters per second or one thousand one hundred twentyfive feet per second it took me a couple days to realize i was in fact still alive i mean sure id had my moment of elation when i had first realized id been rescued but it didnt sink in after watching my ship tear apart after spending a good twentythree hours floating in silence in the wreck wondering whether i was currently facing stars belonging to the constellation libra or the constellation orion when those stars were viewed from earth wondering what it felt like to suffocate and after the feeling that yes i was in fact going to die alone in space had sunk in it took time for that feeling to dissipate fact i wasnt dead after i realized this i left my quarters the lightscreen provided had informed me when and where official meals were taking place but i hadnt bothered to acknowledge the invitations it hadnt seemed relevant somehow given that i was still reeling over the explosion the deaths of my crewmates and the rescue ive heard there are a number of stages of grief and shock i guess i was working my way through them food was delivered to my quarters initially i couldnt figure out whyi hadnt requested any be sent then i realized someone must have noticed i hadnt left and was nice enough to send food my way the accompanying bottle of wine was a nice touch i must have consumed it too because later on the plates and the bottle were both empty i spent a lot of time lying on my back on the bed staring up at the little etched swirls in the ceiling or slumped in the oldfashioned armchair staring out the windows at the stars i did a lot of staring and not moving man was it good to be done with that stage it was time to find out what hell looked like fact hell is other people sure the ship was spacious we didnt pick up many passengersjust the select special few scattered here and there between the stars but we were all on this ship and we were on it together cliques form in any decentsized group of people me i was singled out by sarah an unassuming fortysomething lady with a glass of champagne in one hand and the arm of a scrawny but tall blond man in the other she sidled up to me as i was scooping little round crackers and what appeared to be a baked cilantro cream dip onto a plate the plate by the way was already loaded with folded pieces of smoked pink fish paprikadusted deviled eggs toothpicks stabbed through green vegetables and slices of cheese and balls of meat smothered in a tomatobased sauce luxurious even compared to the fare one would find in the highclass space stations and pleasure cruisers compared to what a mere engineer would get on your typical cargo ship it was mouthwateringly lipsmackingly gorgeous i wondered if the food delivered to my quarters the past few days had been similarly amazing i decided it couldnt have been liking the taste of the sweet life eh im sarah and this is alexisyou must be the new pickup she looked me over approvingly come on lets get you a glass of champagne i looked longingly at the slices of cheddar olive bread as she whisked me over to the bar but didnt protest the bar was manned by an expensive humanoid robot it turned toward sarahs wave and acknowledged her with a nod moments later setting a fluted glass of sparkling liquid in front of her i marveled at the robots smoothness and coordination clearly it was a highend model sarah transferred the glass to my free hand and pulled me away from the bar for more introductions with alexis trailing after us i spent the evening listening mostly listening and stuffing my face with all the bits of fine food provided no one minded sarahs inner circle was content to fill our circle of couches with plenty of chatter ray a plump man who was grey where he wasnt bald zheng short and dark and lean with a very intense gaze he made me a little uncomfortable kishori petite her hair strung out in a series of braids that reached nearly to her waist i categorized them based on their appearances hoping id be able to pick them out of the crowd again later most of their chatter was meaningless to mestories of daytoday activities how soandso had been seen in soandsos table at lunch and my wasnt that a surprise and why hadnt the chef concocted this delectable a selection of appetizers for the dance the other night but of course those rolled meat pastries reminded one of the pastries back on earth didnt they and this was somehow an interesting fact after the first halfhour i stopped expending effort to keep names and stories and gossip straight i wasnt learning anything useful i could have started asking questions but i wanted to get my bearings first tonight was for observation i didnt bother trying to seek out a different group of potentially more interesting people though they all looked the same clusters of social butterflies surrounded by the less apt the hangerson the circle with whom the gossip was shared i wondered at the ship instead all the fine food and the ornamental lighting it had to be exorbitantly pricey to maintain if the barkeep was any indication i suspected similarly highclass robots fulfilled other positions on the ship how they were all powered was a mysteryas good as the technology got a quality robot like that was still an energy sink it was the brain mostly the amount of information the machine had to process to be able to function at the level it did ate up a lot of resources sarahs crowd took turns taking my champagne flute to the bar to be refilled all seemingly pleased to have a new set of ears to talk at i slowly returned my attention to the conversation and was pleasantly surprised to find that it had turned to a heated analysis of a recent abstract filmdone in the style of old flatscreen moviesthat i had seen during offtime at geminia station by the end of the evening when i finally followed the slow trickle of people out of the room a satisfying haze had settled on my mind it was nice i decided this ship this life the nagging questions about where the ship had come from and what its purpose in rescuing me was still nagged but somehow seemed less urgent did it truly matter what the ships origin was and why jefferson had saved me if now i was content fact its easy to fall into patterns i would wake late checking the clock on my rooms lightscreen to make sure i hadnt slept through brunch i would join the rest of the ship for meals and i would take my turn in the weight room i would watch old films on the entertainment screens taking mental notes for later dinnertime discussions i would immerse myself in new virtual reality flicks i would attend afternoon dance classes so that when the evening dances came around modeled after the historical social gatherings of several hundred years prior i would be less of an embarrassment to myself i did not ask questions i told myself i should i told myself that tonight the observation period would end and id start puzzling out the ships mystery but i fell under the ships sway bereft of my previous familiar life i latched onto kishori and ray and zheng and sarah with alexis dragged along on her arm now and then he was mostly her favorite dancing partner she confided to us one night that his conversational skills left something to be desired i smothered thoughts of friends back on earththis was my longawaited vacation my clean break and my temporary retreat id try contacting those friends tomorrow i continued to care little for shipwide gossip but our discussions of films and flicks old and new brought out my artistic storyloving argumentative side a side of me id tucked into a back storage compartment during my years as an engineer it was a good life if surreal but i wasnt sure i wanted the dream stage to end fact some places are timeless days passed weeks passed but i couldnt tell if it had been months or years since i was rescued all there was all i remembered was a blur gathering for drinks in the parlors playing dress up with all the fine clothes i found in the closets some of it modern some of it period dress for special themed events idling in the lounges now and then a new face mingled in the crowd other faces washed out fading into the backdrop of carpets and fake glass chandeliers and the muted hum of the engines one of these evenings we were gathered in the south ballroom for postdinner drinks lounging on couches and watching other members of our populace move in circles on the dance floor the south was in the title to suggest that there were more ballrooms there werent sarahs circle had picked up another newcomer adrienne a short blond girl who we all agreed was barely old enough to attend a traditional university back on earth let alone work on the ship in whose wreck jefferson had found her maybe it was her curiosity asking a question i should have asked long before that turned the conversation serious maybe there was just something special about that evening maybe we had all tired of the frivolity of our life hitting some threshold or some breaking point regardless when adrienne asked what the ships purpose was we all gave it a measure of thought we dredged up halffledged theories and inchoate explanations tossing these out the same way we pitched ideas about the art films i believe well see the end of the universe said tiffany captains cohort she had a glass of orangebrown liquid in one hand it might have been orange juice and some kind of berry liquor she swirled it speculatively i watched adrienne she tilted her head listening not speaking impossible said zheng sitting in the chair to her left we cant live that long maybe the universe will end sooner than you think said jefferson yeah the captain was there with the rest of us he didnt drink but he made a point of mingling with all the various cliques maybe well travel at the speed of light and we wont age said sarah setting her wine glass on the little round end table by her couch maybe were already traveling at the speed of light tiffany she nodded eagerly relatively says it all zheng scoffed also impossible even if we were traveling at ninetynine percent of the speed of lightthats assuming you ignore science and pretend that such a thing is possible because it isntwed still age wed just appear to age slower than people not traveling as fast as us and said sarah aging is relative anyway besides i wouldnt mind being around forever give our ancestors purpose keep their dreams alive new hypothesis suggested kishori slipping into the conversation no ones immortal in fact the opposite were all going to die bleak commented zheng but i like it he grinned at sarah who frowned ray took a drink from his glass of ice water and shook his head were all going to die so what better thing to do than enjoy the time we have kishori gestured to the bar the carpets the paintings all the luxuries money can buy tiffany took a drink thinking all the luxuries money can buy she echoed zheng looked skeptical paid for how smuggling responded kishori matteroffact jefferson snorted amused think about it kishori continued where else would we get the money to buy all this renegade smugglers so whats our cargo eh captain zheng joked leaning back in his chair with his glass of wine jefferson shook his head and stood up ill leave you to your speculation he said a chorus of good nights followed him out the door after the captain left zheng leaned in he set his glass down on an end table steepled his fingers together were revolting he told us and i dont mean that you disgust me no were the start of a rebellion did you hear what the captain said earlier he means were going to change the future the universe as we know it wont be the same thats dumb said sarah wouldnt we know it if we were part of a rebellion zheng shook his head the captain selected us for a reason he has inside intelligencehow else would he know where to find us he knows about us thats still dumb said sarah inside intelligence dont you remember theres not exactly one big galactic government from which to steal information i still like my idea said tiffany me i followed adriennes example and didnt speak up fabricating excuses to myself to stay safely in gatherinfo observation mode though i thought zheng had a point jefferson didnt share how he found people he didnt share how he knew exactly where the wrecks were or why he saved some people but not others but then again no one asked i guess we all figured he knew what he was doing he had been at this savior business longer than any of us i wondered if adrienne would ask about that were going to mean something zheng was saying what we do rebelling against the oppression of the many governments that oppose us were going to leave a legacy he sounded certain enthusiastic even ray he shook his head and broke the quiet hed held most of the evening youve got it all wrong he looked from sarah to adrienne to zheng to kishori and tiffany to me obviously we cant last longer than the rest of the universe we arent giving anyone purpose were not even going to leave a legacy all were doing is existing all were doing is eating and drinking and shitting breathing and fucking and nothing important ever we arent special again bleak commented zheng adrienne gestured for him to be quiet she leaned forward setting her elbows on the foot stool in front of her you never know when it will end ray continued not addressing any one of us in particular you cant hold on forever even if you dont ever ever want to forget how long until the memories slip away how long until all you remember is this the ship the thick red carpeting the chandeliers the empty conversations you hold with the other shells who used to be people when your life the reason you lived the people and faces and places the emotions you felt who and what you loved when all that is gone faded what will you have left i wondered how long ray had been on this ship i wondered why if he had such an unpropitious outlook he hadnt tried to change his situation i wanted to ask but he was still talking and i was too selfconscious to interrupt you can try to hold on said ray you can try and try and try repeat stories to yourself in the artificial night sketch faces in your mind you can make their names your mantra but words if you repeat them enough times lose their meaning emily emily emillee emilee ehmillee ehmihlee my wifes name once repeat it enough times its just a sound no longer grounded ray he said if we last forever if our eyes are the last eyes watching as the stars blink out it wont mean a thing to us we wont care that were last and we wont care that there are no more stars we arent angels were just dumb and lucky pure dumb luck he said struck a nerve huh said zheng sorry said ray how long ago was that asked adrienne leaving your wife i mean traveling on this ship ray he looked down at his hands folded together in his lap fingers interlaced i dont know he said we were all quiet for a moment ray shrugged then got up and left we let him go silent selfconscious more excuses were made and after a few moments only adrienne and i were left sitting in the ballroom she looked across the circle of couches at me whats your theory she asked me i shrugged how long have you been here not that long i said a couple weeks i guess maybe a month or two why dont you know for sure she asked i shrugged i hadnt been counting days what did you do before this how were you found i was an engineer i explained how my ship had malfunctioned no warning at all the explosions the impossible rescue i dont know how jefferson knew to find me there she nodded the ship i was on i guess thats what happened too some vital part broke and well boom it was all so fast she took a sip of her drink plain water because she had explained earlier she had never liked the taste of alcohol then fixed her gaze on me im going to figure it out she said how and why this ship exists ill figure it out then im going to find a way home i paced my room that night unable to sleep the more i thought about it the less sense the ship made worse adrienne had made this clear to me with a single question i had spent weeks asking nothing contentedly getting nowhere fact adrienne intimidated me fact its too easy to fall into patterns i resolved to break the pattern another evening another chandeliered room another swirl of conversations and dances and hor doevres another circle of chairs and couches another uncomfortable question has anyone ever left adrienne looked at each of us in turn ray exchanged a glance with zheng sarah frowned now that you mention it i havent seen alexis in days i assumed he was indisposed kishori nodded in agreement i looked at ray and raised an eyebrow what well ray said slowly people do leave the approximate number of people at any given event is always the same but we see new faces youre sure its not just some people being indisposed asked adrienne using sarahs phrasing zheng shook his head and picked up a handful of candied pecans from a little dish on the end table keep adding people long enough regardless you get more overall a couple people staying in their rooms even if you switch out the people wont make a difference he dropped the pecans back into the dish one by one so where do they go adrienne focused on zheng i cut in maybe a better question is does anyone ever come back ray and zheng exchanged another glance kishori chewed her lip sarah shrugged and sipped at her drink after a moment ray said i dont think so are there patterns adrienne asked who leaves again there was an uncomfortable moment of silence i hazarded a guess you dont notice do you sarah looked indignant of course we notice but well no one important ever disappears so it doesnt really matter does it i could tell she was trying to remember whom she had known who had left and failing no one contradicted her no one offered a different answer i looked at adrienne mission accomplished our routine insouciance had been disrupted the scales had tipped even when the conversation returned to lighter tones as it soon did i dwelt on adriennes questions from the looks on my companions faces i knew they were thinking the same how long have you been here the question previously posed to me was presented to the rest of our group excluding ray adrienne had been tactful enough to wait until he had gone for a refill recalling the last time the subject was broached sarah she tilted her head and tapped a finger on the side of her wine glass a long time got to be months and months at least you were here before i was said kishori and so was tiffany i looked at zheng he shrugged time passes in a weird way here i kept track for a whilethirtyeight daysbut after that i guess i didnt see the point fact some places are timeless why not asked adrienne days dont matter he said the eleventh of a month or the seventeenth whether its wednesday or sunday summer back on earth or winter it doesnt affect us here tiffany nodded but kishori spoke before the other woman could why are you so interested she asked adrienne adrienne met her gaze i dont want to be here forever but were not here forever objected sarah remember alexis left disappeared i corrected her we dont know how or why he left or where he went zheng looked thoughtful he picked up his glass swirled the liquid around took a sip then set the glass back down he glanced around at the rest of us do you want to leave he asked could you live anywhere else now i spoke up yes i said i wouldnt miss this much no one else said anything i watched adriennes eyes move from one face to the next zheng he addressed me again leaning forward with his elbows on his knees and an intense steady gaze you think that he said but is it true would you be happy back in a normal life working and living and crying in the drudgery of whatever the hell normal is these days i didnt answer fact its too easy to fall into patterns fact i wasnt sure i wanted the dream stage to end my quarters felt stifling asphyxiating my mind i sat sideways in the armchair feet dangling over one arm neck resting against the other absently tracing invisible lines between the stars outside my window as i ruminated on the situation the lightscreen had proved singularly unhelpful i inspected the arrays of entertainment optionsabstract oldstyle flatscreens engrossing vr flicks and action games a selection of quondam bestsellers and a few recently released novels hoping to gain popularity there was a schedule advertising upcoming onship events such as dance classes craft sessions and discussion groups and a list of dinner invitations for me to respond to a menu of display options allowing me to customize all the lightscreens superficial characteristics a simple contact system for communicating with other people on the ship that was all a methodical search of my two adjoining rooms the ample closet space and the attached bathroom facility had similarly provided no fodder furniture dark wood expensive polished no secret compartments clothes leftover tray of halfconsumed food from the previous days lunch toiletries complete with miniature bottles of sweetsmelling apricot honey lotion lightscreen me i was discouraged and frustrated i wanted to prove to adrienne that i wanted solve the ships mystery just as much as she did i wanted to find something anything that would prove all this was normal and sane i didnt want to think about disappearances and time and purposes and consequences i wanted my contentment back i cornered adrienne at dinner that night in one hand i balanced my plate of starshaped crackers globs of elegant dips and garnishes little rolled balls of meats and cheeses stabbed through with spears of some pale green plant and an array of other delectable bitesized items my other hand pointedly steered adrienne to a small table against a wall she glared at me but obediently let me pull her along tell me i said after we sat what you have found it wasnt a question she gave me a grumpy look that informed me quite clearly of her current opinion of me not if youre going to be rude about it i sighed sorry i wasnt not really but id lie to get the conversation going i want to know i explained in two brief sentences my earlier impasse i dont know much she said still annoyed but at least cooperative she reviewed the information gleaned from our previous dinner conversations adding i heard the captain say something yesterday as i walking to the pyrope parlor i was just coming up on a corner and he was around the other side talking to a couple people and they must not have known i was there he said something about a wreck going well and listen when they came round the corner ray was with the captain the next time the captain stopped by our group tiffany tagging along pretending that she too was a social butterfly who could mingle equally well with everyone we were ready is there a doctor on board asked adrienne ive been having headaches it was a lie but we needed information jefferson nodded down past the emerald lounge second door on the left all hours a robot then medical ai were even more expensive than the barkeep i wondered how many people it treated had anyone on the ship ever fallen seriously ill does he age asked adrienne the captain i shrugged i never thought about it adrienne steepled her fingers and studied my face that doesnt answer my question she said adrienne only picked at her food not hungry asked kishori sympathetically no said adrienne at least have a drink said sarah i find it takes the edge off she doesnt drink remember said kishori maybe thats the problem said sarah one hundred and fortyseven is a magic number said sarah you ever heard of dunbar well weve got the perfectsize group right here just enough for us all to recognize each other just enough for us all to be able to barely avoid killing each other why doesnt anyone mutiny adrienne asked if you dislike this place so much why dont you do something about it we cant said ray what would we do adrienne shook her head and made a sound of disgust you could force the captain to set down somewhere let us off the ship if he refuses threaten him if he still refuses well of all of us isnt there someone who can drive a ship thats murder objected sarah thats survival adrienne corrected her do you want to be stuck here for the rest of your life sarah didnt reply i shifted my feet in the plush green carpeting of the emerald lounge looking out the windows at the stars times like that running on less sleep than i should alone because everyone else had had the sense to retire for the night i had a tendency to get all meditative about the universe and my place in it the stillness of the room contributed as did the view black and more black speckled by tiny points of light that flared up to break the emptiness if only for a brief time all of it was temporary save for the black that was tonights melodramatic theme the ephemeral nature of life everything temporary everything to fade away lost as dust and scattered atoms between the stars and every one of us to be left as alone as the moment we were born thinking about that i wondered if sarahs theory was right after all some things in this world we have to make them permanent ourselves and jefferson he had done that he had made us a constant he made this shipthis lifea constant the one thing that was known the one thing that wouldnt change maybe everything we did all the stories we told maybe it was all lies maybe wed never know each other not truly because we all hid behind the stories creating the realities we wanted to see but ultimately this ship its purpose our purposedid it matter we each had our own theory maybe that was enough and all of us we were permanent characters in each others stories maybe that made us more real maybe it made us feel less alone mind if i join you i turned to see adrienne in the doorway she smiled then crossed the room to join me by the window not waiting for an answer some nights i said i cant see the meaning in any of it all these things i do theyre just to pass the time until i die adrienne looked at me then back out through the window you dont see a meaning because there is no meaning she said after all of it as much as we feared being alone we feared being vulnerable even more our instinct was to hide look what i found adrienne said in her hands was a bottle and what happens to adrienne i couldnt find her jefferson was in the captains lounge fact sound is a vibration the speed of sound in dry air at twenty degrees celsius or sixtyeight degrees fahrenheit is three hundred and fortythree meters per second or one thousand one hundred twentyfive feet per second up his dosage i heard the captain say ive got a replacement lined up i ran i didnt want to forget i didnt want to be harvested the last thing i remember i was tearing down the corridors life boats i thought every ship had life boats in case of emergency break glass id find one id put on a space suit id get out of this ship id find civilization again a planet a space station some other ship any place but this place failing all else id suffocate alone ray he caught me as i pounded on the corridor walls finding no glass to break relax he told me sliding a needle into my arm itll pass he told me he held me in his arms until i stopped flailing it passed this is my hotel california i can never leave

 introduction as recognized by the presidents national energy plan nep one of the principal energy challenges facing us is increasing our energy supplies in ways that protect and improve the environment thus the president directed epa to propose legislation that would significantly reduce so2 nox and mercury emissions from power generation through a cap and trade program such a program coupled with appropriate measures to address local concerns would provide significant health benefits even as we increase energy supplies and maintain reasonable electricity rates our work on this issue has given us insight that i believe will be helpful to you the more i learn about the cost and inefficiencies of the current and future regulatory regime to which power generators will be subjected if we do not have new legislation the more i am convinced that we can and must develop a smarter approach that protects the environment and public health while reducing the cost to consumers and industry and optimizing the size of both the state and federal government machinery necessary to achieve that protection it is possible to achieve better results at lower costs but not if we simply add yet another program on top of all of the existing regulations the current clean air act has been enormously successful but we can do better significant cost savings can be achieved for power generators and consumers through a comprehensive legislative package i look forward to working with you to develop such an approach to reduce emissions from power generation we applaud senator jeffords for tackling this important issue and for recognizing that a cap and trade program is the best way to achieve these reductions however we have significant concerns with s 556 as drafted our analysis to date suggests that it could increase consumers electricity rates by as much as 50 which we believe is unacceptable in addition the combination of emission reductions and timing is not feasible and could threaten the reliability of electricity supply we are concerned that s 556s short timeframes for installation of controls could lead power plants to be taken offline at important times which could lead to electricity shortages in addition there are a number of issues that congress should consider that s 556 does not address as drafted s 556 would make some existing requirements unnecessary but would not eliminate them rather than add yet another layer of environmental regulations on top of the existing ones we believe that s 556 should eliminate those unnecessary existing requirements s 556 also does not have an allocation scheme one lesson we should learn from the success of the acid rain cap and trade program is that when certain key issues can be resolved through clear legislation we can avoid years of litigation business uncertainty and costs and delayed environmental protection finally and most importantly the administration strongly opposes including co2 reductions in any multipollutant bill the co2 provisions in s 556 will cost consumers too much and endanger our energy security by causing too much electricity generation to switch from coal to natural gas greenhouse gas emissions should be addressed in the context of climate change which is being undertaken by the presidents cabinet level working group for all of these reasons the administration must oppose s 556 in my testimony today i will elaborate further on these key points background over the last 30 years we have made substantial progress towards improved environmental quality under the clean air act during this time gross domestic product has increased almost 160 at the same time we have reduced emissions of six key air pollutants by 29 while coal consumption has increased 77 and energy consumption has increased 45 eleven years ago president george h w bush signed into law the most far reaching amendments to the clean air act since its enactment in 1970 included in those amendments was the acid rain cap and trade program the first program tailored specifically to the utility sector which is achieving significant environmental and public health benefits at a fraction of the initial cost estimates and with relatively little government bureaucracy it is time to revisit and update the clean air act once again in order to achieve the additional reductions needed to address public health and environmental problems in the most cost effective manner the acid rain program is achieving its emission reduction goal at a fraction of the estimated costs because it allows and encourages innovative thinking and long range planning1 the existing program establishes a cap on so2 emissions to ensure that the environmental goal is met and employs an innovative marketbased allowance trading program to achieve the goal at lowest cost allowances are the currency with which compliance with the so2 emissions requirements is achieved sources rather than government decide the most costeffective way to use available resources to comply units that reduce their emissions below the number of allowances they hold may trade allowances with other units in the system sell them to other sources or save them for future use there are neither restrictions on trading nor government secondguessing allowance trading provides incentives for energy conservation and technology innovation that can both lower the cost of compliance and yield pollution prevention benefits simply the allowance market puts a price or value on each ton of so2 not emitted the association of a monetary value with reduced emissions encourages innovation in the 1990s scrubber costs decreased by approximately 40 and scrubber sulfur removal efficiencies improved from 90 to 95 and experimentation led to the blending of fuels to lower emissions to ensure that the cap is met and to provide credibility sources also are required to install systems that continuously monitor and report emissions the acid rain program has proven to be an excellent model for cap and trade programs compliance with the program has been nearly 100 percent and annual emissions of so2 from power plants have already been reduced over 6 million tons about 35 percent from 1980 levels greater reductions earlier than expected have lowered risks to human health and provided benefits to the environment sooner acid rain levels were dramatically reduced over large areas of the us and trading did not result in geographic shifting of emissions or hot spots as some feared despite the significant progress we have made under the clean air act air emissions from power generators are still contributing to serious public health and environmental problems administrator whitman addressed these concerns extensively in her testimony before you on july 26 2001 rather than reiterate her testimony i will emphasize just a few of her key points problems associated with sulfur dioxide so2 nitrogen oxides nox and mercury emissions are of national and international significance and the interstate and long range transport of emissions continue to play significant roles in the nature and magnitude of the problems emission and deposition of so2 nox and mercury and their transformation byproducts are known to have a wide range of adverse effects on human health and the environment including so2 and nox emissions contribute to fine particles which are associated with premature mortality aggravated chronic bronchitis hospitalizations due to cardiorespiratory symptoms emergency room visits due to aggravated asthma symptoms and acute respiratory symptoms 1 governor whitmans july 26 2001 testimony before this committee contains a detailed discussion of the success of the acid rain cap and trade program fine particles formed from power plant emissions as well as mobile source emissions are of concern nox emissions contribute to groundlevel ozone which aggravates respiratory illnesses and causes lung inflammation particularly for atrisk populations such as children the elderly and those afflicted with asthma emphysema and other respiratory ailments mercury emissions contribute to mercury deposition in water children born to women who consume large amounts of mercurycontaminated fish while pregnant may be at risk for neurodevelopmental defects so2 and nox emissions contribute to atmospheric sulfate and nitrate concentrations that cause visibility impairment including impairment in many national parks and wilderness areas so2 and nox contribute to acid deposition which damages lakes and streams adversely affecting the fish and other species that live in them and leaches nutrients from the soil nox emissions contribute to nitrogen deposition that may lead to eutrophication of estuaries and nearcoastal waters and can damage forested watersheds epa states and industry working together have made important strides in addressing the adverse impacts of fossil fuel combustion by the electric power industry since the passage of the clean air act in 1970 despite significant improvements in air quality throughout the country however emissions from power generation continue to result in serious health environmental and economic impacts in 1999 the electric power industry was responsible for 67 of sulfur dioxide emissions 25 of nitrogen oxide emissions and 37 of mercury emissions in the united states business as usual the presidents flexible marketbased approach to reducing emissions from power generators stands in sharp contrast to the complex web of existing regulations which currently confront the industry over the years congress epa and the states have responded to specific environmental and public health problems by developing separate regulatory programs to address the specific problems each individual program uses its own approach on its own timeline to serve its own purpose absent changes to the act epa and states will be forced to follow the same approach in future regulations it is time to consolidate and simplify to achieve our clean air goals a comprehensive legislative approach with mandatory caps could replace a good portion of the current regulatory requirements with a system that will reduce the administrative burden on industry and governments use marketbased approaches to lower compliance costs reduce consumers costs and increase national energy security by providing the industry with more certainty about its future regulatory obligations by enacting such an approach we can achieve environmental and public health protection more effectively and at less cost if we do it the presidents way it will be a winwin there are many regulations in place that will reduce air emissions from electric power generation these regulations include both federal and state requirements that address a variety of emissions including so2 nox co pm10 and a number of hazardous air pollutants these programs include the national ambient air quality standards for so2 particulate matter and ozone the section 126 and the nox sip call rules the acid rain program new source review new source performance standards and the regional haze rule but the regulation of power generators does not end with existing regulations epa is obligated by a settlement agreement to issue by the end of 2004 a maximum achievable control technology mact standard to require sourcespecific controls of mercury and other hazardous air pollutants from electric utilities emissions reductions are required by the end of 2007 states will also be requiring utilities to comply with best available retrofit technology bart programs either sourcespecific standards or a trading program to meet requirements to reduce regional haze it is expected that the existing fine particle and ozone standards now in place will also result in further regulation of power generators modeling shows that when full implementation of existing regulations such as the acid rain program the nox sip call the tier ii standards for cars and trucks the heavy duty diesel engine standards and the low sulfur gasoline and diesel fuel rules are taken into account additional reductions will be needed to bring areas into attainment states will be required to develop plans for these areas in addition nox and so2 reductions are also needed to reduce continuing damage from acid rain and nitrogen deposition because states and epa will have to find some way to significantly reduce nox and so2 emissions it is probable that power generators will be required to reduce their emissions significantly power generation accounts for a significant percentage of these emissions and our analysis shows that there are significant reductions available at lower cost than from other sources additionally states know that if they do not get the reductions from power generators they will have to impose significant reduction requirements on other local industrial and commercial sources or impose local transportation control measures under current law the necessary reductions would be achieved through the development of individual state plans states will not just control their own sources however they will be reaching out to control power generators and large industrial facilities in other states because transport from other states contributes to both ozone and fine particle pollution in many areas this is what has happened in the eastern part of the country when states realized that emissions from sources in other states were significantly contributing to their 1hour ozone nonattainment problems under section 126 of the clean air act a state can petition epa and request that epa require reductions from sources outside the petitioning states borders the petitioning state is entitled to relief if epa finds that the sources are significantly contributing to the petitioning states nonattainment problem epas requirement adopted in response to section 126 petitions that sources in a number of eastern states reduce nox emissions was recently upheld by the court of appeals for the district of columbia circuit since states now know that epa has authority to address transport pollution through responses to 126 petitions or by issuing a rule like the nox sip call we anticipate that states will be turning to these types of control approaches early in the sip process although those of us who are traveling that path with the current 126 petitions and nox sip call believe it will eventually take us to our environmental goal it has been and still is a very rocky road for industry environmentalists the states epa and other stakeholders this oneatatime uncoordinated series of regulatory requirements for the power industry is not the optimal approach for the environment the power generation sector or american consumers with most plants needing to install control equipment to meet these requirements it is likely that this approach would lead to installation of controls that become obsolete and stranded capital investments as additional requirements are promulgated further the attainment efforts of individual states and localities not only impose costs on these entities but also can increase complexity for companies which face differing requirements when operations cross state lines these factors are exacerbated by limited timeframes that may constrain available compliance options and thwart long range planning these and other inefficiencies point to the need for a nationally coordinated approach that could reduce cost while improving environmental progress and accountability changing the way we do business certainty flexibility accountability and innovation we believe there is a better way one that could cost american consumers and industry far less than under current law and ensure protection of the air we breathe in a far more certain straightforward manner i know that many members of this committee share that belief and are also working to develop such an approach it would provide power generators with more certainty about their regulatory future and thus allow them to make wiser decisions about investments in new technology which would improve energy security this administration is developing such a proposal it will build on the successes of the acid rain cap and trade program it would establish national capandtrade programs for nox so2 and mercury emissions from power generators with appropriate measures to address local concerns such an approach will benefit the power generation industry the economy and the states while improving public health and the environment upfront knowledge of future requirements for multiple pollutants would lead firms to follow significantly different and less expensive compliance strategies at individual plants compared with compliance choices which must be made as requirements are addressed in a sequential manner under the current law the savings come from the opportunity to make costeffective plant investment and retirement decisions with full knowledge of upcoming so2 nox and mercury requirements rather than investing in addon control equipment to meet the requirements of each regulation integration advance knowledge and certainty regarding environmental requirements will have even greater value over the coming decade as the electric power industry undergoes further structural changes an integrated package of measures that addresses both the existing regulatory requirements as well as many future environmental needs would provide the greatest degree of certainty and flexibility for the industry while achieving the necessary emission reductions at lower cost than under current law in exchange for flexibility in methods to control emissions a full accounting of emissions through continuous monitoring and reporting is essential as well as significant consequences for failing to comply such provisions have been critical to the success of the acid rain program encouraging individual sources to find the most costeffective means of compliance with the collective emission reduction goal flexibility stimulates technological innovation fuels economic activity and reduces cost to industry and consumers strategies and technologies for the control of so2 nox and mercury emissions exist now and improved methods are expected to become available over the next several years the air pollution control and monitoring technology industry is expected to continue to respond with costeffective compliance solutions just as they have done for the past 30 years a predictable demand for such jobs over the next 15 years is preferable to the boom and bust cycle created by the current regulatory approach this approach also would reduce states administrative burdens and obligations a national cap and trade program with appropriate caps for nox and so2 could provide the emission reductions necessary to bring a significant number of areas into attainment with the ozone and fine particle standards even those areas that would not be brought into attainment by these caps would need significantly fewer emission reductions to come into attainment our approach would significantly reduce the state resources needed to conduct modeling planning and regulatory activities to attain the standards additionally the acid rain cap and trade program is administered with a relatively small staff relying on strong stateoftheart data tracking and reporting capabilities thus welldesigned national cap and trade programs can help use government resources and taxpayer dollars more efficiently at both the state and federal level caps ensure that environmental goals are met a cap that represents significant reductions of emissions protects the environment by reducing overall loadings consideration of local concerns is important in conjunction with trading provisions therefore the national energy plan recommended that the administrations approach include appropriate measures to address local concerns such as the unlikely occurrence of an so2 hot spot or area of concentrated emissions significant reductions will go a long way towards addressing local concerns in addition epa will be conducting modeling that will predict where emissions reductions will occur under the acid rain cap and trade program we have not seen local hot spots because the highest emitters are often the most costeffective to control and therefore the most likely to control as i mentioned epa and the administration are still in the process of developing our proposal several guidelines are shaping our efforts these guidelines may provide a valuable basis as you weigh the proposals before you they will also guide our assessment of other proposals including s 556 these principles are structured to ensure consistency with the nep objectives the nep goals of increasing energy supplies accelerating the protection and improvement of the environment and increasing our nations energy supply must be advanced towards that end energy diversity the preservation of electricity generation and transmission reliability and improvement of energy 9 efficiencyenergy intensity of the electric power industry should be a key consideration in particular to prevent the reoccurrence of energy shortages and price volatility a diverse mix of fuel sources should be maintained specific comments on s 556 we share the desire expressed in s 556 to significantly reduce and cap emissions of so2 nox and mercury from power generation we applaud your acknowledgment of marketbased incentives particularly cap and trade systems as a powerful tool in environmental protection in this way s 556 builds on successful elements of the clean air act we do however oppose s 556 because of concerns with the bill both with some provisions that are in the bill and with some that are missing we believe the emission reductions and timing in the bill will be too costly for consumers and will endanger national energy security we believe the bill is missing some provisions it should address the allocation scheme and integration with existing programs finally we oppose inclusion of co2 in this bill first let me explain some of our specific concerns about the so2 nox and mercury provisions in the bill we are concerned that the significant emissions reductions are required too quickly we do not believe it is reasonable to expect all the control technology installations to be completed in that time frame without very high costs and electricity reliability problems to meet these deadlines facilities may need to be taken offline during critical periods reliability problems could arise as large amounts of capacity are taken out of service for extended periods of time to install the control equipment necessary to meet the emissions reduction requirements the abbreviated time frame would force many generators to make these retrofits simultaneously this would significantly reduce the amount of generating capacity available to meet consumer electrical needs we have not modeled the specific provisions in s 556 but useful information is provided by comparing the analyses epa and eia conducted to respond to a request from senators smith voinovich and brownback with the analyses responding to a request from senators jeffords and lieberman in the smithvoinovichbrownback analysis when we analyzed so2 and nox reduction levels similar to s 556 mercury reduction levels more modest than s 556 and no co2 reductions we did not find significant impacts on coal production or electricity prices however in the analysis responding to the jeffordslieberman request that had nox so2 mercury and co2 reduction levels similar to s 556 we found significant ramifications approximately a 2030 decline of coal generation and a 3050 increase in electricity prices compared to the reference case depending on assumptions of energy technology penetration the 90 sourcespecific control for mercury is also problematic we have not seen anything that demonstrates that every coalfired power plant would be able to achieve 90 sourcespecific controls for mercury by 2007 without considerable fuel switching which would be very disruptive to our economy and undermine energy security in addition requiring the same level of reduction at a plant that emits 01 pounds of mercury and a plant that emits 2000 pounds of mercury regardless of cost is neither efficient nor necessary we are also very concerned about the outdated power plant provision requiring every plant over 30 years old to meet new source performance standards and new source review modification requirements seems unnecessary and could undermine the benefits of the cap and trade approach allowing sources to make reductions where it is most economical to do so is one of the reasons cap and trade programs should be less costly than commandandcontrol programs that achieve the same or even fewer reductions when you have a hard cap as you would under s 556 requiring emission reductions at a specific source does not reduce the overall level of pollution it just limits industrys flexibility about where to make the reductions layering additional requirements such as the outdated power plants provision on top of a cap and trade program is very likely to increase costs without providing significant environmental benefits second we have concerns about what is not in s 556 comparing our experience on the acid rain program with the nox sip call and the section 126 petitions demonstrates the benefit of having certain key issues decided by congress rather than left to agency rulemakings congressional resolution of key issues simplifies whatever agency rulemaking is needed and decreases the opportunities for the program to get tied up in protracted litigation perhaps the most important program element not addressed in the bill is integration of this new program with the existing clean air act provisions an effective marketbased approach would make some existing provisions of the clean air act unnecessary for example depending on the ultimate cap levels chosen by congress this type of legislation would obviate the need for best available retrofit technology requirements mercury mact and new source review casebycase technology requirements for power generators also missing from s 556 is the scheme for allocating allowances developing an allocation scheme requires answering numerous questions should the allowances be auctioned off or be handed out for free if they are not auctioned should they be allocated based on heat input or electrical and steam output should power generators that do not emit air pollutants eg hydropower facilities be given allowances should allowance allocations be updated and if so how frequently should allocations be fuel neutral imbedded in these and other questions are important environmental and energy policy choices with significant equity consequences it may not be efficient for epa to make these choices in rulemaking there are other issues as well that this committee should consider such as coordination with existing state and regional programs like the western regional air partnership and the nox reduction programs in the east the committee may also wish to consider provisions to track environmental progress to evaluate the efficacy of the program this bill would establish finally the administration strongly opposes including reductions for co2 in s 556 or any multipollutant bill pursuing sharp reductions in co2 from the electricity generating sector alone would cause a dramatic shift from coal to natural gas and thus would run the risk of endangering national energy security substantially increasing energy prices and harming consumers the administration will not support any legislation that would cause a significant decline in our nations ability to use coal as a major source of current and future electricity at the same time the administration will not support any legislation that does not enhance the cleanliness of coalfired electricity generation and promote a future for clean coal technologies in short the administration supports a clean coal policy as a critical component of our nations energy and environmental policies recognizing that other sources of energy also have a critical role to play additionally as governor whitman said when she testified before you in july including co2 in this bill will slow down if not prevent the consensus necessary for passage of legislation to control multiple emissions from power plants governor whitman and i both believe consensus on the appropriate levels and timing for reductions of nox so2 and mercury is achievable relatively soon we should not delay the public health and environmental benefits from reduction of these emissions while we wait for consensus to develop on co2 we agree that climate change is a serious issue we need to address however co2 has never been regulated as a pollutant under the clean air act and does not pose any direct threat to human health unlike nox so2 and mercury the current body of scientific knowledge does not provide information regarding atmospheric concentrations of co2 or reduction levels necessary to prevent dangerous interference with the climate system in april the president convened a cabinetlevel policy review of this issue and was provided with initial recommendations that he accepted and announced on june 11 in that regard the administration is implementing two major initiatives on climate science and advanced energy and sequestration technologies the united states now spends 16 billion annually on climate science to reduce uncertainties a commitment unmatched by any other nation the national climate change technology initiative will accelerate priority research and the application of advanced energy and sequestration technologies recognizing that the real answer to addressing climate change in the long term lies in the development and global introduction of such technologies in this century and the cabinetlevel policy review is ongoing finally as greenhouse gas emissions are projected to grow exponentially in the developing world in the next two decades we must evaluate the costs of imposing domestic reductions as a very high cost against potentially lowcost opportunities for mitigating and sequestering carbon emissions in the developing world we appreciate the role of s 556 in generating important discussions and emphasizing the importance of a new approach to controlling emissions in the power sector i look forward to the additional hearings you will need to address these important issues and to working with the committee to develop an approach that the president can support the history of clean air act legislation is one of great accomplishments made possible by bipartisan efforts i thank you for the opportunity to work with you to continue that great tradition

commission hereby transmits its report on the scope of existing authority of the united states postal service under current postal laws and regulations to introduce new products and services and to enter into negotiated service agreements with individual customers or groups of customers respectfully submitted george a omas chairman ruth y goldway vice chairman dana b covington sr commissioner report to the congress appendix postal service product innovations and specialpurpose mail classification changes reviewed by the postal rate commission since january 1 2000 i summary this report provides an analysis of the united states postal services current legal authority to 1 introduce and provide new products and services and 2 enter into negotiated service agreements with individual customers this report also includes background on the use of such authority within the past two years the commissions analysis of existing postal law yields the following conclusions the postal reorganization act of 1970 gives the united states postal service a clear mandate to innovate by developing effective and efficient services adapted to the needs of the nations mail users the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail services is the joint authority shared by the postal service and the postal rate commission to adopt new mail classifications under 39 usc 3623 through 3625 the postal rate commission has developed specialized procedural rules that provide for expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of other interested persons negotiated service agreements nsas or niche classifications are rate and service adjustments arranged by the postal service and potential users that are legally permissible provided that the proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding as the reorganization act requires the agreedupon rate and service changes will work to the mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole and the negotiated rateandservice package is made available on the same terms to other potential users willing to meet the same conditions of service ii background and scope of analysis in joint deliberations on appropriations for the united states postal service and certain other agencies and departments for fiscal year 2002 the committee of conference directed both the postal service and the postal rate commission to prepare reports on particular areas of the postal services authority under existing law1 specifically the conferees directed both the united states postal service and the postal rate commission to independently report 90 days after enactment of this act on the scope of existing authority of the us postal service

107th cong 1st sess 59 2001 as directed the commission submits this report to the senate and house of representatives committees on appropriations the senate committee on governmental affairs and the house committee on government reform the report is presented in three sections the first outlines the postal services current legal authority to introduce new products and services the role of the postal rate commission in that process and the procedural mechanisms available for expedited approval of such innovations the second section addresses the same topics in connection with negotiated service agreements nsas socalled niche classifications which are special service and rate arrangements negotiated between the postal service and a particular mailer or groups of mailers with features tailored to their use of the postal system finally an appendix to the report summarizes recent 1 the amended bill produced by the conference committee was enacted as pub l no 10767 115 stat 514 2001 commission proceedings in which the postal service has sought to introduce service innovationssome of them customized for particular groups of mailerson an expedited basis iii postal service authority to develop introduce and provide new products and services a innovation under the postal reorganization act while preexisting law afforded limited opportunities for postal innovation2 the postal reorganization act of 1970 gave the newlycreated united states postal service a clear mandate to innovate by developing effective and efficient services adapted to the needs of the nations mail users section 101a of title 39 establishes the postal services paramount obligation to provide postal services to bind the nation together through the personal educational literary and business correspondence of the people the same section establishes the performance criterion that the postal service is expected to achieve as a matter of postal policy it shall provide prompt reliable and efficient services to patrons in all areas and all communities similarly 403a assigns the postal service the duty to plan develop promote and provide adequate and efficient postal services at fair and reasonable rates and fees the act fosters service innovation by assigning the postal service responsibility to provide types of mail service to meet the needs of different categories of mail and mail users 39 usc 403b2 the reorganization act grants the postal service specific powers that serve as the operational tools of service innovation section 404 of title 39 grants the postal service plenary authority over custody of the mail and its movement 404a1 over the deployment of post offices other facilities and equipment 404a3 and over the means by which stamps and other postage are sold 404a4 and 5 the same section also authorizes the postal service to provide establish change or abolish special nonpostal or similar services 39 usc 404a6 conclusion the postal reorganization act of 1970 clearly mandates that the postal service innovate by developing effective and efficient postal services adapted to the needs of the nations mail users 2 former 39 usc 504a authorized the postmaster general to maintain a research and development program and to conduct experiments to enhance the operational efficiency and economy of the postal system b commission review of proposed changes in domestic mail classifications prior to 1970 the array of mail services provided by the post office department was codified as part of title 393 the reorganization act replaced this statutory codification of postal services with an administrative process in which the governors of the postal service establish and the postal rate commission reviews proposed changes in the terms and conditions of postal services which are compiled as the domestic mail classification schedule or dmcs4 section 3621 of title 39 provides that the governors are authorized to establish reasonable and equitable classes of mail in accordance with the provisions of this chapter section 3623a directs the postal service to file a request with the postal rate commission for a recommended decision on establishing a mail classification schedule within two years of the reorganization acts effective date the postal service complied with this requirement early in 1973 and a domestic mail classification schedule recommended by the commission became effective on july 6 19765 following establishment of this initial mail classification schedule 3623b provides that the postal service may from time to time request that the commission submit or the commission may submit to the governors on its own initiative a recommended decision on changes in the mail classification schedule deliberations on proposed mail classification changes follow proceedings in which an opportunity for on the record hearings is afforded to mail users and an officer of the commission required to represent the interests of the general public 39 usc 3624a the commissions procedural rules governing proposed changes in the mail classification schedule are contained in subpart c of title 39 of the code of federal regulations 39 cfr 300161 et seq 3 see former title 39 part ivmail matter 4 the text of the domestic mail classification schedule is published as appendix a to subpart c of 39 cfr part 3001 following 39 cfr 300168 5 docket no mc731 phase i opinion and recommended decision april 15 1976 accepted in decision of the governors of the united states postal service on establishing a mail classification schedule june 2 1976 over the past 25 years the postal service has filed many such mail classification requests with the commission seeking either to establish new postal products or to reconfigure preexisting services less frequently the commission has begun proceedings on its own initiative most commonly in response to a mail users request to do so both forms of proceeding have proven to offer useful opportunities to introduce innovations in postal services conclusion the joint authority shared by the postal service and the postal rate commission under the reorganization act to adopt new mail classifications is the mechanism for implementing innovations in domestic mail service c commission procedures adapted to the expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations recognizing that certain types of proposed service innovations merit consideration under specialized procedures the commission has adopted several sets of rules that are customized for defined categories of postal service requests the rules depart from those generally applicable to proposed mail classification changes by reducing the amount of supporting evidence the postal service is required to produce and by expediting the commissions procedural schedule for considering the particular form of proposed change the commission determined almost twenty years ago that there was a need for specialized rules to facilitate postal service mail classification requests involving proposed new services or changes in existing services that were intended to serve as experiments the rules contained in 39 cfr 300167 through 67d provide a mechanism for limiting the issues on which a trialtype hearing is required allow the postal service to explain the unavailability of data that would otherwise have to be filed and provide for data collection for the duration of the experiment the experimental rules also incorporate a procedural time limit of 150 days from the commissions determination that the proposed change is experimental in nature these rules were not used extensively a joint postal servicepostal rate commission task force suggested a number of areas where additional special rules might further encourage postal service innovation6 the postal service petitioned the commission in 1995 to adopt rules to implement some of the task forces recommendations the commission conducted a rulemaking to consider the rules proposed in the services petition and after considering the comments of interested parties implemented four of the proposed initiatives albeit in revised form three of the new sets of rules prescribe expedited procedures for particular categories of postal service requests the fourth set specifies conditions under which the service may use multiyear test periods to demonstrate that a proposed new service will become compensatory over time the first set of these new procedural rules incorporated into the commissions rules of practice as sections 161 through 1667 establish expedited procedures for consideration of postal service proposed market tests of potential new services the rules specify the limited information the service is required to file in support of a proposed market test including a plan for testing the proposed new service and associated data collection and reporting requirements they also streamline public notice and hearing procedures and provide for issuance of a yes or no commission decision on the proposed market test within 90 days consistent with the procedural due process rights of interested persons the postal services innovative mailing online service for which a threeyear experimental trial was requested and approved in docket no mc20002 was initially considered and recommended by the commission under the market test rules see the appendix to this report under the heading for docket no mc20002 the second set of rules8 apply to postal service proposals to implement new services that would supplement but not alter existing mail classifications and rates on a provisional basis for a limited time as in the market test rules the provisional service rules identify the supporting information to be provided by the postal service in addition they allow the service to explain why it should not be required to provide 6 see postal ratemaking in a time of change a report by the joint task force on postal ratemaking june 1 1992 7 39 cfr 3001161166 8 39 cfr 3001171176 information called for in the commissions general rules for mail classification proposals the rules likewise expedite public notice and procedural scheduling providing for a yes or no commission decision within 90 days consistent with the due process rights of other parties a third set of rules adopted as sections 69 through 69c of the rules of practice9 applies to postal service requests for permanent mail classification changes that are minor in character minor classification changes are defined as those that would not change any existing rate or fee would not impose any new restriction on eligibility for mailing and would not significantly increase or decrease the estimated contribution of the affected mail subclass or service category to the institutional costs of the postal service the rules specify limited required supporting information allow the service to explain the unavailability of otherwise required data and also streamline procedural scheduling under these rules for minor classification proposals the procedural deadline for rendering a commission decision is 90 days from the filing of the postal service request if no hearings are held and 120 days if hearings are scheduled in the case finally the fourth set of rules contained in sections 181 and 182 of the rules of practice 10 applies to postal service requests for new services that it believes cannot recover all their associated costs in the first full fiscal year of their operation in such instances the services request must be supported by testimony of a postal service witness that explains the rationale for the proposed multiyear test period the request should also provide return on investment projections other available financial analyses and cost revenue and volume estimates for the new service for the entire proposed test period the rules establish a policy standard that allows test periods of up to five fiscal years for the purpose of determining breakeven for newly introduced postal services the commission adopted these four sets of rules in 1996 to be effective for a period of five years in light of their apparent workability in several commission proceedings and their continuing usefulness for affording procedural flexibility to the 9 39 cfr 30016969c 10 39 cfr 3001181182 postal service the commission extended their application for an additional fiveyear period in a recent rulemaking11 conclusion specialized postal rate commission rules of procedure are currently available for use by the postal service to provide expeditious consideration of proposed service innovations in a manner consistent with the due process rights of all interested persons 11 docket no rm20013 order no 1322 66 fed reg 54436 2001 iv postal service authority to enter into negotiated rate and service agreements with individual customers or groups of customers to provide services for a number of years some mailers have pursued the idea of establishing customized postal rates andor terms of service through negotiation with the postal service depending on their respective objectives and features contractual arrangements of this kind have been labeled contract rates negotiated service agreements or more recently niche classifications in addressing the consistency of these various approaches with current law it is important to identify and consider all of their characteristics for example the legality of an agreement may be dependent on whether the contract is agreed upon and performed without any regulatory scrutiny or instead submitted for some form of review by the postal rate commission prior to its effectiveness a statutory bases of potential authority no provision in existing law explicitly authorizes or prohibits the postal service from entering into rate or service agreements with mail users section 4013 of title 39 generally empowers the service to enter into and perform contracts and there is no prohibition elsewhere against the postal service and mail users negotiating and reaching consensus as to how rates or conditions of service should be changed however other provisions in title 39 cast into doubt the conclusion that the services authority under 4013 is sufficiently broad to encompass changes in rates or mail classifications by agreement alone the obstacles to this conclusion are both procedural and substantive from a procedural perspective the legal soundness of rate or mail classification changes by contract alone is doubtful because the only means of making such changes recognized in the reorganization act are the procedures prescribed in chapter 36 of title 39 these provisions require that rate or mail classification changes desired by the postal service must be filed as a request with the postal rate commission allowing for public scrutiny and deliberations by the commission and the governors of the postal service failure to abide by the procedural requirements of chapter 36 has been recognized as a sufficient legal basis for voiding the intended change12 negotiated rate or service changes also may run afoul of the substantive standards prescribed for rates and mail classifications in the reorganization act section 403c of title 39 directs that in providing services and in establishing classifications rates and fees under this title the postal service shall not except as specifically authorized in this title make any undue or unreasonable discrimination among users of the mails nor shall it grant any undue or unreasonable preferences to any such user sections 3622 and 3623 similarly specify fairness and equity together with other criteria as considerations to be observed in making rate and mail classification changes without public scrutiny and review of the terms of a given rate or service agreement between the postal service and a customer there could be no assurance that these substantive criteria would be satisfied however assuming the procedural requirements of chapter 36 are met changes negotiated by the postal service and a mail user for their mutual benefit may merit recommendation under the applicable statutory standards section 3623c directs the commission to consider the desirability and justification for special classifications and services of mail 3623c2 and the desirability of special classifications from the point of view of both the user and of the postal service 3623c5 regarding rates 3622b6 establishes the degree of preparation of mail for delivery into the postal system performed by the mailer and its effect upon reducing costs to the postal service as a factor to be considered in connection with a proposed change in combination with other factors and the policies of the reorganization act these 12 united parcel service v u s postal service 455 fsupp 857 ed pa 1978 affirmed 604 f2d 1370 3d cir 1979 cert denied 446 us 957 1980 considerations could support recommendation of rate and classification changes tailored to the capabilities and needs of particular mailers conclusion rate and service agreements negotiated by the postal service and mail users are permissible under current law if the procedural and substantive requirements of the postal reorganization act are satisfied b problematical contract rates in a rulemaking proceeding conducted in the late 1980s at the request of a mailer the commission addressed the question of the postal services authority to negotiate rate changes in the form of a proposal to recognize contract rates after considering comments of the postal service and other participants the commission found the proposal problematical and declined to pursue it the initial proposal considered in docket no rm895 included two variants 1 the commission might after considering cost and other relevant evidence establish a range of permissible rates for particular subclasses with the postal service and individual mailers free thereafter to negotiate rates within this range or 2 the postal service and one or more mailers would negotiate a rate and service package which would then i be submitted to the commission for a review and ii thereafter be available on the same terms to all potential users the commission solicited two rounds of comments on the proposal from interested parties the proponent and one other mailer took the position that the postal service is authorized to enter into such contracts provided the procedural requirement of review under chapter 36 is observed other commentersincluding the commissions office of consumer advocateexpressed doubts regarding the legal soundness of one or both of the proposed variants of such agreements the postal service commented that in its view legal constraints would not preclude a contract mechanism in principle but that no such arrangement would be permissible without the commissions participation in accordance with 39 usc 3622 through 3625 upon consideration of the initial comments it received the commission declined to pursue the contract rate proposal but solicited further comments on several broad issues concerning possible changes in the mail classification system the commission explained that its reluctance to pursue the concept of contract rates was based on substantial uncertainty regarding the legal sufficiency of examining agreedupon rates after the fact rather than in a prior review it also raised the potential problems of unreasonable discrimination that such contracts might cause in contravention of 39 usc 403c and the preservation of fair contributions to the postal services institutional costs by mail volumes13 such problems might well arise if the service were to negotiate discounted ratesunaccompanied by a change in service conditions that provided cost or revenue justification conclusion negotiated ratesunaccompanied by a change in service conditions that provides cost justificationare a problematical approach to introducing additional flexibility into postal service business practices c negotiated service agreements and specialized niche classifications following publication of the report of the joint postal servicepostal rate commission task force on ratemaking the postal service petitioned the commission to adopt rules to implement some of the reports recommendations one recommendation included in the services petition was adoption of commission rules for reviewing on an expedited basis service agreements with postal customers varying from the general rate and classifications schedules in ways which add value both for the customer and for the postal system as a whole14 the proposal in the postal services petition would have established negotiated service agreements as a new form of mail classification with individual agreements to be reviewed by the commission within 60 days in the commissions notice of proposed rulemaking it deferred consideration of the nsa proposal citing legal uncertainty regarding the consistency of negotiated rates with the reorganization acts 13 docket no rm895 further invitation for comments 54 fed reg 47223 1989 14 postal ratemaking in a time of change supra at 54 ratemaking provisions however the commission also expressed a general willingness to address the concept in a subsequent rulemaking since then the commission has conducted several mail classification proceedings under the other expedited procedures adopted in that rulemaking these procedures have been shown to be well suited to the consideration of niche classification proposals niche classifications are specialized mail classifications including reduced but costjustified rates or feesthat have been developed by the postal service in direct consultation with its customers to meet the needs and capabilities of a mailer or group of mailers for example the commission approved a twoyear experiment of a program that enabled users of bulk nonlettersize business reply mail such as photofinishers that could reliably determine postage and fees due to obtain earlier access to their mail at revised fees15 the commission subsequently granted a requested extension of the experiment16 and ultimately approved a request to make the experimental program a permanent mail classification17 more recently in docket no mc20011 the commission recommended three new worksharingbased discounted priority mail categories after negotiating with mailers who were willing to presort their mail in new ways that could reduce the postal services costs18 such niche classification proposals are essentially negotiated service agreements without any associated legal uncertainties or additional administrative barriers conclusion rate and service adjustments agreed upon by the postal service and mailers are legally authorized if three conditions are satisfied the proposal is reviewed in a public proceeding as the reorganization act requires the agreedupon rate and service changes will work to the mutual benefit of mail users and the postal system as a whole and 15 docket no mc971 opinion and recommended

opp for access to records of a recipient that may include information that may be protected by rules of professional responsibility or the law on attorneyclient privilege such information will hereafter be referred to as privileged or confidential information as applied to opp references to oce and the vice president for administration shall be to opp and the vice president for programs 2 notice to the recipient whenever oce proposes to review the records of a recipient either through an onsite visit or otherwise oce notifies the recipient orally and in writing about the purpose of the visit or review what activities oce will conduct and what specific information and records are planned to be within the scope of the review each review is an ongoing process that may expand based on information reviewed as such oce will notify the recipient orally and in writing when the scope of the review has changed or expanded and what information and records are further required 3 use of intermediaries in all written and oral communications with recipients oce will affirmatively propose that recipients use program staff as an intermediary to review case files or other records containing privileged or confidential information and to answer questions of oce during onsite visits oce will affirmatively encourage recipients to use such intermediaries and will not request direct access to or control over client case files or any other records containing privileged or confidential information 4 flexibility of approaches oce shall consider and seek to accommodate reasonable approaches to access to records proposed by recipients to protect privileged or confidential information so long as such proposed approaches also ensure access by oce to information it needs to carry out its responsibilities such reasonable approaches may include unique client identifiers when appropriate 5 unique state ethics rules lsc acknowledges that there may be states where the rules of professional responsibility ethics rulings case law or other laws differ from the general framework under the model rules of professional responsibility and where the disclosures sought by oce may implicate the recipient attorneys professional responsibilities or other law recipients have the responsibility to bring such ethical rulings to the attention of oce as set forth in section 7 below after they have been notified by oce of an impending request for access to records containing privileged or confidential information 6 questions of attorneyclient privilege oce shall not have access to information protected by the attorneyclient privilege including information covered by section 509h a recipient shall notify oce under the procedures set forth in section 7 below that the information sought is in the recipients view protected by the attorneyclient privilege 7 procedures for addressing privileged or confidential information if a recipient believes that documents or information requested by oce contain information that is protected by the attorneyclient privilege applicable rules of professional responsibility or other law the recipient will send written notice to oce as soon as possible setting forth 1 a full description of the nature of the privileged or confidential information 2 a statement explaining the basis for determining that such information is privileged or confidential and 3 any recommendations of reasonable approaches to accessing such information upon receipt of this notice oce will so notify the vice president for administration and seek to find a mutually satisfactory manner for obtaining access to the information consistent with the applicable rules of attorneyclient privilege and professional responsibility and consistent with lscs need for information to ensure compliance if oce is not able to expediently resolve all outstanding issues of concern it will through the vice president for administration promptly so advise lscs president and the vice presidents for programs legal affairs and government relations of the access issues raised and the specific reasons why the proposed alternative methods of access are inadequate the vice president for administration and programs with advice of the office of legal affairs then will review the concerns raised by the recipient if the vice presidents for administration and programs do not agree with the position of the recipient then lsc will so notify the recipient in writing and oce will proceed with the review if vice presidents for administration and programs agree that the recipient has a reasonable claim that the information is privileged or confidential then oce will further seek to develop a mutually satisfactory manner for obtaining access to the

 wartime after the attacks had occurred while crisis managers were still sorting out a number of unnerving false alarms air force one flew to barksdale air force base in louisiana one of these alarms was of a reported threat against air force one itself a threat eventually run down to a misunderstood communication in the hectic white house situation room that morning while the plan at the elementary school had been to return to washington by the time air force one was airborne at 955 am the secret service the presidents advisers and vice president cheney were strongly advising against it president bush reluctantly acceded to this advice and at about 1010 air force one changed course and began heading due west the immediate objective was to find a safe locationnot too far awaywhere the president could land and speak to the american people the secret service was also interested in refueling the aircraft and paring down the size of the traveling party the presidents military aide an air force officer quickly researched the options and sometime around 1020 identified barksdale air force base as an appropriate interim destination when air force one landed at barksdale at about 1145 personnel from the local secret service office were still en route to the airfield the motorcade consisted of a military police lead vehicle and a van the proposed briefing theater had no phones or electrical outlets staff scrambled to prepare another room for the presidents remarks while the lead secret service agent reviewed the security situation with superiors in washington the president completed his statement which for security reasons was taped and not broadcast live and the traveling party returned to air force one the next destination was discussed once again the secret service recommended against returning to washington and the vice president agreed offutt air force base in nebraska was chosen because of its elaborate command and control facilities and because it could accommodate overnight lodging for 50 persons the secret service wanted a place where the president could spend several days if necessary air force one arrived at offutt at 250 pm at about 315 president bush met with his principal advisers through a secure video teleconference rice said president bush began the meeting with the words were at war and that director of central intelligence george tenet said the agency was still assessing who was responsible but the early signs all pointed to al qaeda that evening the deputies committee returned to the pending presidential directive they had labored over during the summer the secretary of defense directed the nations armed forces to defense condition 3 an increased state of military readiness for the first time in history all nonemergency civilian aircraft in the united states were grounded stranding tens of thousands of passengers across the country contingency plans for the continuity of government and the evacuation of leaders had been implemented the pentagon had been struck the white house or the capitol had narrowly escaped direct attack extraordinary security precautions were put in place at the nations borders and ports in the late afternoon the president overruled his aides continuing reluctance to have him return to washington and ordered air force one back to andrews air force base he was flown by helicopter back to the white house passing over the stillsmoldering pentagon at 830 that evening president bush addressed the nation from the white house after emphasizing that the first priority was to help the injured and protect against any further attacks he said we will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them he quoted psalm 23though i walk through the valley of the shadow of death no american he saidwill ever forget this day following his speech president bush met again with his national security council nsc expanded to include secretary of transportation norman mineta and joseph allbaugh the director of the federal emergency management agency secretary of state colin powell who had returned from peru after hearing of the attacks joined the discussion they reviewed the days events immediate responses at home as the urgent domestic issues accumulated white house deputy chief of staff joshua bolten chaired a temporary domestic consequences group the agenda in those first days is worth noting partly as a checklist for future crisis planners it began with problems of how to help victims and stanch the flowing losses to the american economy such as organizing federal emergency assistance one question was what kind of public health advice to give about the air quality in lower manhattan in the vicinity of the fallen buildings compensating victims they evaluated legislative options eventually setting up a federal compensation fund and defining the powers of a special master to run it determining federal assistance on september 13 president bush promised to provide 20 billion for new york city in addition to the 20 billion his budget director had already guessed might be needed for the country as a whole restoring civil aviation on the morning of september 13 the national airspace reopened for use by airports that met newly improvised security standards reopening the financial markets after extraordinary emergency efforts involving the white house the treasury department and the securities and exchange commission aided by unprecedented cooperation among the usually competitive firms of the financial industry the markets reopened on monday september 17 deciding when and how to return border and port security to more normal operations evaluating legislative proposals to bail out the airline industry and cap its liability the very process of reviewing these issues underscored the absence of an effective government organization dedicated to assessing vulnerabilities and handling problems of protection and preparedness though a number of agencies had some part of the task none had security as its primary mission by september 14 vice president cheney had decided to recommend at least as a first step a new white house entity to coordinate all the relevant agencies rather than tackle the challenge of combining them in a new department this new white house entity would be a homeland security adviser and homeland security councilparalleling the national security council system vice president cheney reviewed the proposal with president bush and other advisers president bush announced the new post and its first occupant pennsylvania governor tom ridgein his address to a joint session of congress on september 20 beginning on september 11 immigration and naturalization service agents working in cooperation with the fbi began arresting individuals for immigration violations whom they encountered while following up leads in the fbis investigation of the 911 attacks eventually 768 aliens were arrested as special interest detainees some such as zacarias moussaoui were actually in ins custody before 911 most were arrested after attorney general john ashcroft told us that he saw his job in directing this effort as risk minimization both to find out who had committed the attacks and to prevent a subsequent attack ashcroft ordered all special interest immigration hearings closed to the public family members and press directed government attorneys to seek denial of bond until such time as they were cleared of terrorist connections by the fbi and other agencies and ordered the identity of the detainees kept secret ins attorneys charged with prosecuting the immigration violations had trouble getting information about the detainees and any terrorist connections in the chaos after the attacks it was very difficult to reach law enforcement officials who were following up on other leads the clearance process approved by the justice department was timeconsuming lasting an average of about 80 days we have assessed this effort to detain aliens of special interest the detainees were lawfully held on immigration charges records indicate that 531 were deported 162 were released on bond 24 received some kind of immigration benefits 12 had their proceedings terminated and 8one of whom was moussaouiwere remanded to the custody of the us marshals service the inspector general of the justice department found significant problems in the way the 911 detainees were treated in response to a request about the counterterrorism benefits of the 911 detainee program the justice department cited six individuals on the special interest detainee list noting that two including moussaoui were linked directly to a terrorist organization and that it had obtained new leads helpful to the investigation of the 911 terrorist attacks a senior al qaeda detainee has stated that us government efforts after the 911 attacks to monitor the american homeland including review of muslims immigration files and deportation of nonpermanent residents forced al qaeda to operate less freely in the united states the governments ability to collect intelligence inside the united states and the sharing of such information between the intelligence and law enforcement communities was not a priority before 911 guidelines on this subject issued in august 2001 by deputy attorney general larrythompson essentially recapitulated prior guidance however the attacks of 911 changed everything less than one week after september 11 an early version of what was to become the patriot act officially the usa patriot act began to take shape a central provision of the proposal was the removal of the wall on information sharing between the intelligence and law enforcement communities discussed in chapter 3 ashcroft told us he was determined to take every conceivable action within the limits of the constitution to identify potential terrorists and deter additional attacks the administration developed a proposal that eventually passed both houses of congress by large majorities and was signed into law on october 26 flights of saudi nationals leaving the united states three questions have arisen with respect to the departure of saudi nationals from the united states in the immediate aftermath of 911 1 did any flights of saudi nationals take place before national airspace reopened on september 13 2001 2 was there any political intervention to facilitate the departure of saudi nationals 3 did the fbi screen saudi nationals thoroughly before their departure first we found no evidence that any flights of saudi nationals domestic or international took place before the reopening of national airspace on the morning of september 13 2001 to the contrary every flight we have identified occurred after national airspace reopened second we found no evidence of political intervention we found no evidence that anyone at the white house above the level of richard clarke participated in a decision on the departure of saudi nationals the issue came up in one of the many video teleconferences of the interagency group clarke chaired and clarke said he approved of how the fbi was dealing with the matter when it came up for interagency discussion at his level clarke told us i asked the fbi dale watson to handle that to check to see if that was all right with them to see if they wanted access to any of these people and to get back to me and if they had no objections it would be fine with me clarke addedi have no recollection of clearing it with anybody at the white house although white house chief of staff andrew card remembered someone telling him about the saudi request shortly after 911 he said he had not talked to the saudis and did not ask anyone to do anything about it the president and vice president told us they were not aware of the issue at all until it surfaced much later in the media none of the officials we interviewed recalled any intervention or direction on this matter from any political appointee third we believe that the fbi conducted a satisfactory screening of saudi nationals who left the united states on charter flights the saudi government was advised of and agreed to the fbis requirements that passengers be identified and checked against various databases before the flights departed the federal aviation administration representative working in the fbi operations center made sure that the fbi was aware of the flights of saudi nationals and was able to screen the passengers before they were allowed to depart the fbi interviewed all persons of interest on these flights prior to their departures they concluded that none of the passengers was connected to the 911 attacks and have since found no evidence to change that conclusion our own independent review of the saudi nationals involved confirms that no one with known links to terrorism departed on these flights planning for war by late in the evening of september 11 the president had addressed the nation on the terrible events of the day vice president cheney described the presidents mood as somber the long day was not yet over when the larger meeting that included his domestic department heads broke up president bush chaired a smaller meeting of top advisers a group he would later call his war council this group usually included vice president cheney secretary of state powell secretary of defense donald rumsfeld general hugh shelton vice chairman of the joint chiefs later to become chairman general myers dci tenet attorney general ashcroft and fbi director robert mueller from the white house staff national security advisor condoleezza rice and chief of staff card were part of the core group often joined by their deputies stephen hadley and joshua bolten in this restricted national security council meeting the president said it was a time for selfdefense the united states would punish not just the perpetrators of the attacks but also those who harbored them secretary powell said the united states had to make it clear to pakistan afghanistan and the arab states that the time to act was now he said we would need to build a coalition the president noted that the attacks provided a great opportunity to engage russia and china secretary rumsfeld urged the president and the principals to think broadly about who might have harbored the attackers including iraq afghanistan libya sudan and iran he wondered aloud how much evidence the united states would need in order to deal with these countries pointing out that major strikes could take up to 60 days to assemble president bush chaired two more meetings of the nsc on september 12 in the first meeting he stressed that the united states was at war with a new and different kind of enemy the president tasked principals to go beyond their pre911 work and develop a strategy to eliminate terrorists and punish those who support them as they worked on defining the goals and objectives of the upcoming campaign they considered a paper that went beyond al qaeda to propose the elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life an aim that would include pursuing other international terrorist organizations in the middle east rice chaired a principals committee meeting on september 13 in the situation room to refine how the fight against al qaeda would be conducted the principals agreed that the overall message should be that anyone supporting al qaeda would risk harm the united states would need to integrate diplomacy financial measures intelligence and military actions into an overarching strategy the principals also focused on pakistan and what it could do to turn the taliban against al qaeda they concluded that if pakistan decided not to help the united states it too would be at risk the same day deputy secretary of state richard armitage met with the pakistani ambassador to the united states maleeha lodhi and the visiting head of pakistans military intelligence service mahmud ahmed armitage said that the united states wanted pakistan to take seven steps to stop al qaeda operatives at its border and end all logistical support for bin ladin to give the united states blanket overflight and landing rights for all necessary military and intelligence operations to provide territorial access to us and allied military intelligence and other personnel to conduct operations against al qaeda to provide the united states with intelligence information to continue to publicly condemn the terrorist acts to cut off all shipments of fuel to the taliban and stop recruits from going to afghanistan and if the evidence implicated bin ladin and al qaeda and the taliban continued to harbor them to break relations with the taliban government pakistan made its decision swiftly that afternoon secretary of state powell announced at the beginning of an nsc meeting that pakistani president musharraf had agreed to every us request for support in the war on terrorism the next day the us embassy in islamabad confirmed that musharraf and his top military commanders had agreed to all seven demands pakistan will need full us support as it proceeds with us the embassy noted musharraf said the gop government of pakistan was making substantial concessions in allowing use of its territory and that he would pay a domestic price his standing in pakistan was certain to suffer to counterbalance that he needed to show that pakistan was benefiting from his decisions at the september 13 nsc meeting when secretary powell described pakistans reply president bush led a discussion of an appropriate ultimatum to the taliban he also ordered secretary rumsfeld to develop a military plan against the taliban the president wanted the united states to strike the taliban step back wait to see if they got the message and hit them hard if they did not he made clear that the military should focus on targets that would influence the talibans behavior president bush also tasked the state department which on the following day delivered to the white house a paper titled game plan for a political military strategy for pakistan and afghanistan the paper took it as a given that bin ladin would continue to act against the united states even while under taliban control it therefore detailed specific us demands for the taliban surrender bin ladin and his chief lieutenants including ayman al zawahiri tell the united states what the taliban knew about al qaeda and its operations close all terrorist camps free all imprisoned foreigners and comply with all un security council resolutions the state department proposed delivering an ultimatum to the taliban produce bin ladin and his deputies and shut down al qaeda camps within 24 to 48 hours or the united states will use all necessary means to destroy the terrorist infrastructure the state department did not expect the taliban to comply therefore state and defense would plan to build an international coalition to go into afghanistan both departments would consult with nato and other allies and request intelligence basing and other support from countries according to their capabilities and resources finally the plan detailed a public us stance america would use all its resources to eliminate terrorism as a threat punish those responsible for the 911 attacks hold states and other actors responsible for providing sanctuary to terrorists work with a coalition to eliminate terrorist groups and networks and avoid malice toward any people religion or culture president bush recalled that he quickly realized that the administration would have to invade afghanistan with ground troops but the early briefings to the president and secretary rumsfeld on military options were disappointing tommy franks the commanding general of central command centcom told us that the president was dissatisfied the us military franks said did not have an offtheshelf plan to eliminate the al qaeda threat in afghanistan the existing infinite resolve options did not in his view amount to such a plan all these diplomatic and military plans were reviewed over the weekend of september 1516 as president bush convened his war council at camp david present were vice president cheney rice hadley powell armitage rumsfeld ashcroft mueller tenet deputy secretary of defense paul wolfowitz and cofer black chief of the dcis counterterrorist center tenet described a plan for collecting intelligence and mounting covert operations he proposed inserting cia teams into afghanistan to work with afghan warlords who would join the fight against al qaeda these cia teams would act jointly with the militarys special operations units president bush later praised this proposal saying it had been a turning point in his thinking general shelton briefed the principals on the preliminary plan for afghanistan that the military had put together it drew on the infinite resolve phased campaign plan the pentagon had begun developing in november 2000 as an addition to the strike options it had been refining since 1998 but shelton added a new elementthe possible significant use of ground forces and that is where president bush reportedly focused his attention after hearing from his senior advisers president bush discussed with rice the contents of the directives he would issue to set all the plans into motion rice prepared a paper that president bush then considered with principals on monday morning september 17 the purpose of this meeting he recalled sayingis to assign tasks for the first wave of the war against terrorism it starts today in a written set of instructions slightly refined during the morning meeting president bush charged ashcroft mueller and tenet to develop a plan for homeland defense president bush directed secretary of state powell to deliver an ultimatum to the taliban along the lines that his department had originally proposed the state department was also tasked to develop a plan to stabilize pakistan and to be prepared to notify russia and countries near afghanistan when hostilities were imminent in addition bush and his advisers discussed new legal authorities for covert action in afghanistan including the administrations first memorandum of notification on bin ladin shortly thereafter president bush authorized broad new authorities for the cia president bush instructed rumsfeld and shelton to develop further the camp david military plan to attack the taliban and al qaeda if the taliban rejected the ultimatum the president also tasked rumsfeld to ensure that robust measures to protect american military forces against terrorist attack were implemented worldwide finally he directed treasury secretary paul oneill to craft a plan to target al qaedas funding and seize its assets nsc staff members had begun leading meetings on terrorist fundraising by september 18 also by september 18 powell had contacted 58 of his foreign counterparts and received offers of general aid searchandrescue equipment and personnel and medical assistance teams on the same day deputy secretary of state armitage was called by mahmud ahmed regarding a twoday visit to afghanistan during which the pakistani intelligence chief had met with mullah omar and conveyed the us demands omars response was not negative on all these points but the administration knew that thetaliban was unlikely to turn over bin ladin the pre911 draft presidential directive on al qaeda evolved into a new directive national security presidential directive 9 now titled defeating the terrorist threat to the united states the directive would now extend to a global war on terrorism not just on al qaeda it also incorporated the presidents determination not to distinguish between terrorists and those who harbor them it included a determination to use military force if necessary to end al qaedas sanctuary in afghanistan the new directiveformally signed on october 25 after the fighting in afghanistan had already begunincluded new material followed by annexes discussing each targeted terrorist group the old draft directive on al qaeda became in effect the first annex the united states would strive to eliminate all terrorist networks dry up their financial support and prevent them from acquiring weapons of mass destruction the goal was the elimination of terrorism as a threat to our way of life phase two and the question of iraq president bush had wondered immediately after the attack whether saddam husseins regime might have had a hand in it iraq had been an enemy of the united states for 11 years and was the only place in the world where the united states was engaged in ongoing combat operations as a former pilot the president was struck by the apparent sophistication of the operation and some of the piloting especially hanjours highspeed dive into the pentagon he told us he recalled iraqi support for palestinian suicide terrorists as well speculating about other possible states that could be involved the president told us he also thought about iran clarke has written that on the evening of september 12 president bush told him and some of his staff to explore possible iraqi links to 911 see if saddam did this clarke recalls the president telling them see if hes linked in any way while he believed the details of clarkes account to be incorrect president bush acknowledged that he might well have spoken to clarke at some point asking him about iraq responding to a presidential tasking clarkes office sent a memo to rice on september 18 titled survey of intelligence information on any iraq involvement in the september 11 attacks rices chief staffer on afghanistan zalmay khalilzad concurred in its conclusion that only some anecdotal evidence linked iraq to al qaeda the memo found no compelling case that iraq had either planned or perpetrated the attacks it passed along a few foreign intelligence reports including the czech report alleging an april 2001 prague meeting between atta and an iraqi intelligence officer discussed in chapter 7 and a polish report that personnel at the headquarters of iraqi intelligence in baghdad were told before september 11 to go on the streets to gauge crowd reaction to an unspecified event arguing that the case for links between iraq and al qaeda was weak the memo pointed out that bin ladin resented the secularism of saddam husseins regime finally the memo said there was no confirmed reporting on saddam cooperating with bin ladin on unconventional weapons on the afternoon of 911 according to contemporaneous notes secretary rumsfeld instructed general myers to obtain quickly as much information as possible the notes indicate that he also told myers that he was not simply interested in striking empty training sites he thought the us response should consider a wide range of options and possibilities the secretary said his instinct was to hit saddam hussein at the same timenot only bin ladin secretary rumsfeld later explained that at the time he had been considering either one of them or perhaps someone else as the responsible party according to rice the issue of what if anything to do about iraq was really engaged at camp david briefing papers on iraq along with many others were in briefing materials for the participants rice told us the administration was concerned that iraq would take advantage of the 911 attacks she recalled that in the first camp david session chaired by the president rumsfeld asked what the administration should do about iraq deputy secretary wolfowitz made the case for striking iraq during this round of the war on terrorism a defense department paper for the camp david briefing book on the strategic concept for the war on terrorism specified three priority targets for initial action al qaeda thetaliban and iraq it argued that of the three al qaeda and iraq posed a strategic threat to the united states iraqs longstanding involvement in terrorism was cited along with its interest in weapons of mass destruction secretary powell recalled that wolfowitznot rumsfeldargued that iraq was ultimately the source of the terrorist problem and should therefore be attacked powell said that wolfowitz was not able to justify his belief that iraq was behind 911 paul was always of the view that iraq was a problem that had to be dealt with powell told us and he saw this as one way of using this event as a way to deal with the iraq problem powell said that president bush did not give wolfowitzs argument much weight though continuing to worry about iraq in the following week powell said president bush saw afghanistan as the priority president bush told bob woodward that the decision not to invade iraq was made at the morning session on september 15 iraq was not even on the table during the september 15 afternoon session which dealt solely with afghanistan rice said that when president bush called her on sunday september 16 he said the focus would be on afghanistan although he still wanted plans for iraq should the country take some action or the administration eventually determine that it had been involved in the 911 attacks at the september 17 nsc meeting there was some further discussion of phase two of the war on terrorism president bush ordered the defense department to be ready to deal with iraq if baghdad acted against us interests with plans to include possibly occupying iraqi oil fields within the pentagon deputy secretary wolfowitz continued to press the case for dealing with iraq writing to rumsfeld on september 17 in a memo headlined preventing more eventshe argued that if there was even a 10 percent chance that saddam hussein was behind the 911 attack maximum priority should be placed on eliminating that threat wolfowitz contended that the odds were far more than 1 in 10 citing saddams praise for the attack his long record of involvement in terrorism and theories that ramzi yousef was an iraqi agent and iraq was behind the 1993 attack on the world trade center the next day wolfowitz renewed the argument writing to rumsfeld about the interest of yousef s coconspirator in the 1995 manila air plot in crashing an explosivesladen plane into cia headquarters and about information from a foreign government regarding iraqis involvement in the attempted hijacking of a gulf air flight given this background he wondered why so little thought had been devoted to the danger of suicide pilots seeing a failure of imagination and a mindset that dismissed possibilities on september 19 rumsfeld offered several thoughts for his commanders as they worked on their contingency plans though he emphasized the worldwide nature of the conflict the references to specific enemies or regions named only the taliban al qaeda and afghanistan shelton told us the administration reviewed all the pentagons war plans and challenged certain assumptions underlying them as any prudent organization or leader should do general tommy franks the commanding general of central command recalled receiving rumsfelds guidance that each regional commander should assess what these plans meant for his area of responsibility he knew he would soon be striking the taliban and al qaeda in afghanistan but he told us he now wondered how that action was connected to what might need to be done in somalia yemen or iraq on september 20 president bush met with british prime minister tony blair and the two leaders discussed the global conflict ahead when blair asked about iraq the president replied that iraq was not the immediate problem some members of his administration he commented had expressed a different view but he was the one responsible for making the decisions franks told us that he was pushing independently to do more robust planning on military responses in iraq during the summer before 911a request president bush denied arguing that the time was not right centcom also began dusting off plans for a full invasion of iraq during this period franks said the centcom commander told us he renewed his appeal for further military planning to respond to iraqi moves shortly after 911 both because he personally felt that iraq and al qaeda might be engaged in some form of collusion and because he worried that saddam might take advantage of the attacks to move against his internal enemies in the northern or southern parts of iraq where the united states was flying regular missions to enforce iraqi nofly zones franks said that president bush again turned down the request having issued directives to guide his administrations preparations for war on thursday september 20 president bush addressed the nation before a joint session of congress tonight he said we are a country awakened to danger the president blamed al qaeda for 911 and the 1998 embassy bombings and for the first time declared that al qaeda was responsible for bombing the uss cole he reiterated the ultimatum that had already been conveyed privately the taliban must act and act immediately he said they will hand over the terrorists or they will share in their fate the president added that americas quarrel was not with islam the enemy of america is not our many muslim friends it is not our many arab friends our enemy is a radical network of terrorists and every government that supports them other regimes faced hard choices he pointed out every nation in every region now has a decision to make either you are with us or you are with the terrorists president bush argued that the new war went beyond bin ladin our war on terror begins with al qaeda but it does not end there he said it will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found stopped and defeated the president had a message for the pentagonthe hour is coming when america will act and you will make us proud he also had a message for those outside the united states this is civilizations fight he said we ask every nation to join us president bush approved military plans to attack afghanistan in meetings with central commands general franks and other advisers on september 21 and october 2 originally titled infinite justice the operations code word was changedto avoid the sensibilities of muslims who associate the power of infinite justice with god aloneto the operational name still used for operations in afghanistanenduring freedom the plan had four phases in phase one the united states and its allies would move forces into the region and arrange to operate from or over neighboring countries such as uzbekistan and pakistan this occurred in the weeks following 911 aided by overwhelming international sympathy for the united states in phase two air strikes and special operations attacks would hit key al qaeda and taliban targets in an innovative joint effort cia and special operations forces would be deployed to work together with each major afghan faction opposed to the taliban the phase two strikes and raids began on october 7 the basing arrangements contemplated for phase one were substantially securedafter arduous effortby the end of that month in phase three the united states would carry out decisive operations using all elements of national power including ground troops to topple the taliban regime and eliminate al qaedas sanctuary in afghanistan mazaresharif in northern afghanistan fell to a coalition assault by afghan and us forces on november 9 four days later the taliban had fled from kabul by early december all major cities had fallen to the coalition on december 22 hamid karzai a pashtun leader from kandahar was installed as the chairman of afghanistans interim administration afghanistan had been liberated from the rule of the taliban in december 2001 afghan forces with limited us support engaged al qaeda elements in a cave complex called tora bora in march 2002 the largest engagement of the war was fought in the mountainous shahikot area south of gardez against a large force of al qaeda jihadists the threeweek battle was substantially successful and almost all remaining al qaeda forces took refuge in pakistans equally mountainous and lightly governed frontier provinces as of july 2004 bin ladin and zawahiri are still believed to be at large in phase four civilian and military operations turned to the indefinite task of what the armed forces call security and stability operations within about two months of the start of combat operations several hundred cia operatives and special forces soldiers backed by the striking power of us aircraft and a much larger infrastructure of intelligence and support efforts had combined with afghan militias and a small number of other coalition soldiers to destroy thetaliban regime and disrupt al qaeda they had killed or captured about a quarter of the enemys known leaders mohammed atef al qaedas military commander and a principal figure in the 911 plot had been killed by a us air strike according to a senior cia officer who helped devise the overall strategy the cia provided intelligence experience cash covert action capabilities and entre to tribal allies in turn the us military offered combat expertise firepower logistics and communications with these initial victories won by the middle of 2002 the global conflict against islamist terrorism became a different kind of struggle

consequence to this nation the profound events of 2007 and 2008 were neither bumps in the road nor an accentuated dip in the financial and business cycles we have come to expect in a free market economic system this was a fundamental disruptiona financial upheaval if you willthat wreaked havoc in communities and neighborhoods across this country as this report goes to print there are more than 26 million americans who are out of work cannot find fulltime work or have given up looking for work about four million families have lost their homes to foreclosure and another four and a half million have slipped into the foreclosure process or are seriously behind on their mortgage payments nearly 11 trillion in household wealth has vanished with retirement accounts and life savings swept away businesses large and small have felt the sting of a deep recession there is much anger about what has transpired and justifiably so many people who abided by all the rules now find themselves out of work and uncertain about their future prospects the collateral damage of this crisis has been real people and real communities the impacts of this crisis are likely to be felt for a generation and the nation faces no easy path to renewed economic strength like so many americans we began our exploration with our own views and some preliminary knowledge about how the worlds strongest financial system came to the brink of collapse even at the time of our appointment to this independent panel much had already been written and said about the crisis yet all of us have been deeply affected by what we have learned in the course of our inquiry we have been at various times fascinated surprised and even shocked by what we saw heard and read ours has been a journey of revelation much attention over the past two years has been focused on the decisions by the federal government to provide massive financial assistance to stabilize the financial system and rescue large financial institutions that were deemed too systemically important to fail those decisionsand the deep emotions surrounding themwill be debated long into the future but our mission was to ask and answer this central question how did it come to pass that in 2008 our nation was forced to choose between two stark and painful alternativeseither risk the total collapse of our financial system and economy or inject trillions of taxpayer dollars into the financial system and an array of companies as millions of americans still lost their jobs their savings and their homes in this report we detail the events of the crisis but a simple summary as we see it is useful at the outset while the vulnerabilities that created the potential for crisis were years in the making it was the collapse of the housing bubblefueled by low interest rates easy and available credit scant regulation and toxic mortgages that was the spark that ignited a string of events which led to a fullblown crisis in the fall of 2008 trillions of dollars in risky mortgages had become embedded throughout the financial system as mortgagerelated securities were packaged repackaged and sold to investors around the world when the bubble burst hundreds of billions of dollars in losses in mortgages and mortgagerelated securities shook markets as well as financial institutions that had significant exposures to those mortgages and had borrowed heavily against them this happened not just in the united states but around the world the losses were magnified by derivatives such as synthetic securities the crisis reached seismic proportions in september 2008 with the failure of lehman brothers and the impending collapse of the insurance giant american international group aig panic fanned by a lack of transparency of the balance sheets of major financial institutions coupled with a tangle of interconnections among institutions perceived to be too big to fail caused the credit markets to seize up trading ground to a halt the stock market plummeted the economy plunged into a deep recession the financial system we examined bears little resemblance to that of our parents generation the changes in the past three decades alone have been remarkable the financial markets have become increasingly globalized technology has transformed the efficiency speed and complexity of financial instruments and transactions there is broader access to and lower costs of financing than ever before and the financial sector itself has become a much more dominant force in our economy from 1978 to 2007 the amount of debt held by the financial sector soared from 3 trillion to 36 trillion more than doubling as a share of gross domestic product the very nature of many wall street firms changedfrom relatively staid private partnerships to publicly traded corporations taking greater and more diverse kinds of risks by 2005 the 10 largest us commercial banks held 55 of the industrys assets more than double the level held in 1990 on the eve of the crisis in 2006 financial sector profits constituted 27 of all corporate profits in the united states up from 15 in 1980 understanding this transformation has been critical to the commissions analysis now to our major findings and conclusions which are based on the facts contained in this report they are offered with the hope that lessons may be learned to help avoid future catastrophe we conclude this financial crisis was avoidable the crisis was the result of human action and inaction not of mother nature or computer models gone haywire the captains of finance and the public stewards of our financial system ignored warnings and failed to question understand and manage evolving risks within a system essential to the wellbeing of the american public theirs was a big miss not a stumble while the business cycle cannot be repealed a crisis of this magnitude need not have occurred to paraphrase shakespeare the fault lies not in the stars but in us despite the expressed view of many on wall street and in washington that the crisis could not have been foreseen or avoided there were warning signs the tragedy was that they were ignored or discounted there was an explosion in risky subprime lending and securitization an unsustainable rise in housing prices widespread reports of egregious and predatory lending practices dramatic increases in household mortgage debt and exponential growth in financial firms trading activities unregulated derivatives and shortterm repo lending markets among many other red flags yet there was pervasive permissiveness little meaningful action was taken to quell the threats in a timely manner the prime example is the federal reserves pivotal failure to stem the flow of toxic mortgages which it could have done by setting prudent mortgagelending standards the federal reserve was the one entity empowered to do so and it did not the record of our examination is replete with evidence of other failures financial institutions made bought and sold mortgage securities they never examined did not care to examine or knew to be defective firms depended on tens of billions of dollars of borrowing that had to be renewed each and every night secured by subprime mortgage securities and major firms and investors blindly relied on credit rating agencies as their arbiters of risk what else could one expect on a highway where there were neither speed limits nor neatly painted lines we conclude widespread failures in financial regulation and supervision proved devastating to the stability of the nations financial markets the sentries were not at their posts in no small part due to the widely accepted faith in the self correcting nature of the markets and the ability of financial institutions to effectively police themselves more than 30 years of deregulation and reliance on selfregulation by financial institutions championed by former federal reserve chairman alan greenspan and others supported by successive administrations and congresses and actively pushed by the powerful financial industry at every turn had stripped away key safeguards which could have helped avoid catastrophe this approach had opened up gaps in oversight of critical areas with trillions of dollars at risk such as the shadow banking system and overthecounter derivatives markets in addition the government permitted financial firms to pick their preferred regulators in what became a race to the weakest supervisor yet we do not accept the view that regulators lacked the power to protect the financial system they had ample power in many arenas and they chose not to use it to give just three examples the securities and exchange commission could have required more capital and halted risky practices at the big investment banks it did not the federal reserve bank of new york and other regulators could have clamped down on citigroups excesses in the runup to the crisis they did not policy makers and regulators could have stopped the runaway mortgage securitization train they did not in case after case after case regulators continued to rate the institutions they oversaw as safe and sound even in the face of mounting troubles often downgrading them just before their collapse and where regulators lacked authority they could have sought it too often they lacked the political willin a political and ideological environment that constrained itas well as the fortitude to critically challenge the institutions and the entire system they were entrusted to oversee changes in the regulatory system occurred in many instances as financial markets evolved but as the report will show the financial industry itself played a key role in weakening regulatory constraints on institutions markets and products it did not surprise the commission that an industry of such wealth and power would exert pressure on policy makers and regulators from 1999 to 2008 the financial sector expended 27 billion in reported federal lobbying expenses individuals and political action committees in the sector made more than 1 billion in campaign contributions what troubled us was the extent to which the nation was deprived of the necessary strength and independence of the oversight necessary to safeguard financial stability we conclude dramatic failures of corporate governance and risk management at many systemically important financial institutions were a key cause of this crisis there was a view that instincts for selfpreservation inside major financial firms would shield them from fatal risktaking without the need for a steady regulatory hand which the firms argued would stifle innovation too many of these institutions acted recklessly taking on too much risk with too little capital and with too much dependence on shortterm funding in many respects this reflected a fundamental change in these institutions particularly the large investment banks and bank holding companies which focused their activities increasingly on risky trading activities that produced hefty profits they took on enormous exposures in acquiring and supporting subprime lenders and creating packaging repackaging and selling trillions of dollars in mortgagerelated securities including synthetic financial products like icarus they never feared flying ever closer to the sun many of these institutions grew aggressively through poorly executed acquisition and integration strategies that made effective management more challenging the ceo of citigroup told the commission that a 40 billion position in highly rated mortgage securities would not in any way have excited my attention and the cohead of citigroups investment bank said he spent a small fraction of 1 of his time on those securities in this instance too big to fail meant too big to manage financial institutions and credit rating agencies embraced mathematical models as reliable predictors of risks replacing judgment in too many instances too often risk management became risk justification compensation systemsdesigned in an environment of cheap money intense competition and light regulationtoo often rewarded the quick deal the shortterm gainwithout proper consideration of longterm consequences often those systems encouraged the big betwhere the payoff on the upside could be huge and the downside limited this was the case up and down the linefrom the corporate boardroom to the mortgage broker on the street our examination revealed stunning instances of governance breakdowns and irresponsibility you will read among other things about aig senior managements ignorance of the terms and risks of the companys 79 billion derivatives exposure to mortgagerelated securities fannie maes quest for bigger market share profits and bonuses which led it to ramp up its exposure to risky loans and securities as the housing market was peaking and the costly surprise when merrill lynchs top management realized that the company held 55 billion in supersenior and supposedly supersafe mortgagerelated securities that resulted in billions of dollars in losses we conclude a combination of excessive borrowing risky investments and lack of transparency put the financial system on a collision course with crisis clearly this vulnerability was related to failures of corporate governance and regulation but it is significant enough by itself to warrant our attention here in the years leading up to the crisis too many financial institutions as well as too many households borrowed to the hilt leaving them vulnerable to financial distress or ruin if the value of their investments declined even modestly for example as of 2007 the five major investment banksbear stearns goldman sachs lehman brothers merrill lynch and morgan stanleywere operating with extraordinarily thin capital by one measure their leverage ratios were as high as 40 to 1 meaning for every 40 in assets there was only 1 in capital to cover losses less than a 3 drop in asset values could wipe out a firm to make matters worse much of their borrowing was shortterm in the overnight marketmeaning the borrowing had to be renewed each and every day for example at the end of 2007 bear stearns had 118 billion in equity and 3836 billion in liabilities and was borrowing as much as 70 billion in the overnight market it was the equivalent of a small business with 50000 in equity borrowing 16 million with 296750 of that due each and every day one cant really ask what were they thinking when it seems that too many of them were thinking alike and the leverage was often hiddenin derivatives positions in offbalancesheet entities and through window dressing of financial reports available to the investing public the kings of leverage were fannie mae and freddie mac the two behemoth government sponsored enterprises gses for example by the end of 2007 fannies and freddies combined leverage ratio including loans they owned and guaranteed stood at 75 to 1 but financial firms were not alone in the borrowing spree from 2001 to 2007 national mortgage debt almost doubled and the amount of mortgage debt per household rose more than 63 from 91500 to 149500 even while wages were essentially stagnant when the housing downturn hit heavily indebted financial firms and families alike were walloped the heavy debt taken on by some financial institutions was exacerbated by the risky assets they were acquiring with that debt as the mortgage and real estate markets churned out riskier and riskier loans and securities many financial institutions loaded up on them by the end of 2007 lehman had amassed 111 billion in commercial and residential real estate holdings and securities which was almost twice what it held just two years before and more than four times its total equity and again the risk wasnt being taken on just by the big financial firms but by families too nearly one in 10 mortgage borrowers in 2005 and 2006 took out option arm loans which meant they could choose to make payments so low that their mortgage balances rose every month within the financial system the dangers of this debt were magnified because transparency was not required or desired massive shortterm borrowing combined with obligations unseen by others in the market heightened the chances the system could rapidly unravel in the early part of the 20th century we erected a series of protections the federal reserve as a lender of last resort federal deposit insurance ample regulationsto provide a bulwark against the panics that had regularly plagued americas banking system in the 19th century yet over the past 30plus years we permitted the growth of a shadow banking systemopaque and laden with short term debtthat rivaled the size of the traditional banking system key components of the marketfor example the multitrilliondollar repo lending market offbalance sheet entities and the use of overthecounter derivativeswere hidden from view without the protections we had constructed to prevent financial meltdowns we had a 21stcentury financial system with 19thcentury safeguards when the housing and mortgage markets cratered the lack of transparency the extraordinary debt loads the shortterm loans and the risky assets all came home to roost what resulted was panic we had reaped what we had sown we conclude the government was ill prepared for the crisis and its inconsistent response added to the uncertainty and panic in the financial markets as part of our charge it was appropriate to review government actions taken in response to the developing crisis not just those policies or actions that preceded it to determine if any of those responses contributed to or exacerbated the crisis as our report shows key policy makersthe treasury department the federal reserve board and the federal reserve bank of new yorkwho were best positioned to watch over our markets were ill prepared for the events of 2007 and 2008 other agencies were also behind the curve they were hampered because they did not have a clear grasp of the financial system they were charged with overseeing particularly as it had evolved in the years leading up to the crisis this was in no small measure due to the lack of transparency in key markets they thought risk had been diversified when in fact it had been concentrated time and again from the spring of 2007 on policy makers and regulators were caught off guard as the contagion spread responding on an ad hoc basis with specific programs to put fingers in the dike there was no comprehensive and strategic plan for containment because they lacked a full understanding of the risks and interconnections in the financial markets some regulators have conceded this error we had allowed the system to race ahead of our ability to protect it while there was some awareness of or at least a debate about the housing bubble the record reflects that senior public officials did not recognize that a bursting of the bubble could threaten the entire financial system throughout the summer of 2007 both federal reserve chairman ben bernanke and treasury secretary henry paul son offered public assurances that the turmoil in the subprime mortgage markets would be contained when bear stearnss hedge funds which were heavily invested in mortgagerelated securities imploded in june 2007 the federal reserve discussed the implications of the collapse despite the fact that so many other funds were exposed to the same risks as those hedge funds the bear stearns funds were thought to be relatively unique days before the collapse of bear stearns in march 2008 sec chairman christopher cox expressed comfort about the capital cushions at the big investment banks it was not until august 2008 just weeks before the government takeover of fannie mae and freddie mac that the treasury department understood the full measure of the dire financial conditions of those two institutions and just a month before lehmans collapse the federal reserve bank of new york was still seeking information on the exposures created by lehmans more than 900000 derivatives contracts in addition the governments inconsistent handling of major financial institutions during the crisisthe decision to rescue bear stearns and then to place fannie mae and freddie mac into conservatorship followed by its decision not to save lehman brothers and then to save aigincreased uncertainty and panic in the market in making these observations we deeply respect and appreciate the efforts made by secretary paulson chairman bernanke and timothy geithner formerly president of the federal reserve bank of new york and now treasury secretary and so many others who labored to stabilize our financial system and our economy in the most chaotic and challenging of circumstances we conclude there was a systemic breakdown in accountability and ethics the integrity of our financial markets and the publics trust in those markets are essential to the economic wellbeing of our nation the soundness and the sustained prosperity of the financial system and our economy rely on the notions of fair dealing responsibility and transparency in our economy we expect businesses and individuals to pursue profits at the same time that they produce products and services of quality and conduct themselves well unfortunatelyas has been the case in past speculative booms and bustswe witnessed an erosion of standards of responsibility and ethics that exacerbated the financial crisis this was not universal but these breaches stretched from the ground level to the corporate suites they resulted not only in significant financial consequences but also in damage to the trust of investors businesses and the public in the financial system for example our examination found according to one measure that the percentage of borrowers who defaulted on their mortgages within just a matter of months after taking a loan nearly doubled from the summer of 2006 to late 2007 this data indicates they likely took out mortgages that they never had the capacity or intention to pay you will read about mortgage brokers who were paid yield spread premiums by lenders to put borrowers into highercost loans so they would get bigger fees often never disclosed to borrowers the report catalogues the rising incidence of mortgage fraud which flourished in an environment of collapsing lending standards and lax regulation the number of suspicious activity reportsreports of possible financial crimes filed by depository banks and their affiliatesrelated to mortgage fraud grew 20fold between 1996 and 2005 and then more than doubled again between 2005 and 2009 one study places the losses resulting from fraud on mortgage loans made between 2005 and 2007 at 112 billion lenders made loans that they knew borrowers could not afford and that could cause massive losses to investors in mortgage securities as early as september 2004 countrywide executives recognized that many of the loans they were originating could result in catastrophic consequences less than a year later they noted that certain highrisk loans they were making could result not only in foreclosures but also in financial and reputational catastrophe for the firm but they did not stop and the report documents that major financial institutions ineffectively sampled loans they were purchasing to package and sell to investors they knew a significant percentage of the sampled loans did not meet their own underwriting standards or those of the originators nonetheless they sold those securities to investors the commissions review of many prospectuses provided to investors found that this critical information was not disclosed these conclusions must be viewed in the context of human nature and individual and societal responsibility first to pin this crisis on mortal flaws like greed and hubris would be simplistic it was the failure to account for human weakness that is relevant to this crisis second we clearly believe the crisis was a result of human mistakes misjudgments and misdeeds that resulted in systemic failures for which our nation has paid dearly as you read this report you will see that specific firms and individuals acted irresponsibly yet a crisis of this magnitude cannot be the work of a few bad actors and such was not the case here at the same time the breadth of this crisis does not mean that everyone is at fault many firms and individuals did not participate in the excesses that spawned disaster we do place special responsibility with the public leaders charged with protecting our financial system those entrusted to run our regulatory agencies and the chief executives of companies whose failures drove us to crisis these individuals sought and accepted positions of significant responsibility and obligation tone at the top does matter and in this instance we were let down no one said no but as a nation we must also accept responsibility for what we permitted to occur collectively but certainly not unanimously we acquiesced to or embraced a system a set of policies and actions that gave rise to our present predicament this report describes the events and the system that propelled our nation toward crisis the complex machinery of our financial markets has many essential gearssome of which played a critical role as the crisis developed and deepened here we render our conclusions about specific components of the system that we believe contributed significantly to the financial meltdown we conclude collapsing mortgagelending standards and the mortgage securitization pipeline lit and spread the flame of contagion and crisis when housing prices fell and mortgage borrowers defaulted the lights began to dim on wall street this report catalogues the corrosion of mortgagelending standards and the securitization pipeline that transported toxic mortgages from neighborhoods across america to investors around the globe many mortgage lenders set the bar so low that lenders simply took eager borrowers qualifications on faith often with a willful disregard for a borrowers ability to pay nearly onequarter of all mortgages made in the first half of 2005 were interest only loans during the same year 68 of option arm loans originated by countrywide and washington mutual had low or nodocumentation requirements these trends were not secret as irresponsible lending including predatory and fraudulent practices became more prevalent the federal reserve and other regulators and authorities heard warnings from many quarters yet the federal reserve neglected its mission to ensure the safety and soundness of the nations banking and financial system and to protect the credit rights of consumers it failed to build the retaining wall before it was too late and the office of the comptroller of the currency and the office of thrift supervision caught up in turf wars preempted state regulators from reining in abuses while many of these mortgages were kept on banks books the bigger money came from global investors who clamored to put their cash into newly created mortgagerelated securities it appeared to financial institutions investors and regulators alike that risk had been conquered the investors held highly rated securities they thought were sure to perform the banks thought they had taken the riskiest loans off their books and regulators saw firms making profits and borrowing costs reduced but each step in the mortgage securitization pipeline depended on the next step to keep demand going from the speculators who flipped houses to the mortgage brokers who scouted the loans to the lenders who issued the mortgages to the financial firms that created the mortgagebacked securities collateralized debt obligations cdos cdos squared and synthetic cdos no one in this pipeline of toxic mortgages had enough skin in the game they all believed they could offload their risks on a moments notice to the next person in line they were wrong when borrowers stopped making mortgage payments the lossesamplified by derivativesrushed through the pipeline as it turned out these losses were concentrated in a set of systemically important financial institutions in the end the system that created millions of mortgages so efficiently has proven to be difficult to unwind its complexity has erected barriers to modifying mortgages so families can stay in their homes and has created further uncertainty about the health of the housing market and financial institutions we conclude overthecounter derivatives contributed significantly to this crisis the enactment of legislation in 2000 to ban the regulation by both the federal and state governments of overthecounter otc derivatives was a key turning point in the march toward the financial crisis from financial firms to corporations to farmers and to investors derivatives have been used to hedge against or speculate on changes in prices rates or indices or even on events such as the potential defaults on debts yet without any oversight otc derivatives rapidly spiraled out of control and out of sight growing to 673 trillion in notional amount this report explains the uncontrolled leverage lack of transparency capital and collateral requirements speculation interconnections among firms and concentrations of risk in this market otc derivatives contributed to the crisis in three significant ways first one type of derivativecredit default swaps cdsfueled the mortgage securitization pipeline cds were sold to investors to protect against the default or decline in value of mortgagerelated securities backed by risky loans companies sold protectionto the tune of 79 billion in aigs caseto investors in these newfangled mortgage securities helping to launch and expand the market and in turn to further fuel the housing bubble second cds were essential to the creation of synthetic cdos these synthetic cdos were merely bets on the performance of real mortgagerelated securities they amplified the losses from the collapse of the housing bubble by allowing multiple bets on the same securities and helped spread them throughout the financial system goldman sachs alone packaged and sold 73 billion in synthetic cdos from july 1 2004 to may 31 2007 synthetic cdos created by goldman referenced more than 3400 mortgage securities and 610 of them were referenced at least twice this is apart from how many times these securities may have been referenced in synthetic cdos created by other firms finally when the housing bubble popped and crisis followed derivatives were in the center of the storm aig which had not been required to put aside capital reserves as a cushion for the protection it was selling was bailed out when it could not meet its obligations the government ultimately committed more than 180 billion because of concerns that aigs collapse would trigger cascading losses throughout the global financial system in addition the existence of millions of derivatives contracts of all types between systemically important financial institutionsunseen and unknown in this unregulated marketadded to uncertainty and escalated panic helping to precipitate government assistance to those institutions we conclude the failures of credit rating agencies were essential cogs in the wheel of financial destruction the three credit rating agencies were key enablers of the financial meltdown the mortgagerelated securities at the heart of the crisis could not have been marketed and sold without their seal of approval investors relied on them often blindly in some cases they were obligated to use them or regulatory capital standards were hinged on them this crisis could not have happened without the rating agencies their ratings helped the market soar and their downgrades through 2007 and 2008 wreaked havoc across markets and firms in our report you will read about the breakdowns at moodys examined by the commission as a case study from 2000 to 2007 moodys rated nearly 45000 mortgagerelated securities as triplea this compares with six privatesector companies in the united states that carried this coveted rating in early 2010 in 2006 alone moodys put its triplea stamp of approval on 30 mortgagerelated securities every working day the results were disastrous 83 of the mortgage securities rated triplea that year ultimately were downgraded you will also read about the forces at work behind the breakdowns at moodys including the flawed computer models the pressure from financial firms that paid for the ratings the relentless drive for market share the lack of resources to do the job despite record profits and the absence of meaningful public oversight and you will see that without the active participation of the rating agencies the market for mortgage related securities could not have been what it became there are many competing views as to the causes of this crisis in this regard the commission has endeavored to address key questions posed to us here we discuss three capital availability and excess liquidity the role of fannie mae and freddie mac the gses and government housing policy first as to the matter of excess liquidity in our report we outline monetary policies and capital flows during the years leading up to the crisis low interest rates widely available capital and international investors seeking to put their money in real estate assets in the united states were prerequisites for the creation of a credit bubble those conditions created increased risks which should have been recognized by market participants policy makers and regulators however it is the commissions conclusion that excess liquidity did not need to cause a crisis it was the failures outlined aboveincluding the failure to effectively rein in excesses in the mortgage and financial marketsthat were the principal causes of this crisis indeed the availability of wellpriced capitalboth foreign and domesticis an opportunity for economic expansion and growth if encouraged to flow in productive directions second we examined the role of the gses with fannie mae serving as the commissions case study in this area these governmentsponsored enterprises had a deeply flawed business model as publicly traded corporations with the implicit backing of and subsidies from the federal government and with a public mission their 5 trillion mortgage exposure and market position were significant in 2005 and 2006 they decided to ramp up their purchase and guarantee of risky mortgages just as the housing market was peaking they used their political power for decades to ward off effective regulation and oversightspending 164 million on lobbying from 1998 to 2008 they suffered from many of the same failures of corporate governance and risk management as the commission discovered in other financial firms through the third quarter of 2010 the treasury department had provided 151 billion in financial support to keep them afloat we conclude that these two entities contributed to the crisis but were not a primary cause importantly gse mortgage securities essentially maintained their value throughout the crisis and did not contribute to the significant financial firm losses that were central to the financial crisis the gses participated in the expansion of subprime and other risky mortgages but they followed rather than led wall street and other lenders in the rush for fools gold they purchased the highest rated nongse mortgagebacked securities and their participation in this market added helium to the housing balloon but their purchases never represented a majority of the market those purchases represented 105 of nongse subprime mortgagebacked securities in 2001 with the share rising to 40 in 2004 and falling back to 28 by 2008 they relaxed their underwriting standards to purchase or guarantee riskier loans and related securities in order to meet stock market analysts and investors expectations for growth to regain market share and to ensure generous compensation for their executives and employeesjustifying their activities on the broad and sustained public policy support for homeownership the commission also probed the performance of the loans purchased or guaranteed by fannie and freddie while they generated substantial losses delinquency rates for gse loans were substantially lower than loans securitized by other financial firms for example data compiled by the commission for a subset of borrowers with similar credit scoresscores below 600show that by the end of 2008 gse mortgages were far less likely to be seriously delinquent than were nongse securitized mortgages 62 versus 283 we also studied at length how the department of housing and urban developments huds affordable housing goals for the gses affected their investment in risky mortgages based on the evidence and interviews with dozens of individuals involved in this subject area we determined these goals only contributed marginally to fannies and freddies participation in those mortgages finally as to the matter of whether government housing policies were a primary cause of the crisis for decades government policy has encouraged homeownership through a set of incentives assistance programs and mandates these policies were put in place and promoted by several administrations and congressesindeed both presidents bill clinton and george w bush set aggressive goals to increase home ownership in conducting our inquiry we took a careful look at huds affordable housing goals as noted above and the community reinvestment act cra the cra was enacted in 1977 to combat redlining by banksthe practice of denying credit to individuals and businesses in certain neighborhoods without regard to their creditworthiness the cra requires banks and savings and loans to lend invest and provide services to the communities from which they take deposits consistent with bank safety and soundness the commission concludes the cra was not a significant factor in subprime lending or the crisis many subprime lenders were not subject to the cra research indicates only 6 of highcost loansa proxy for subprime loanshad any connection to the law loans made by craregulated lenders in the neighborhoods in which they were required to lend were half as likely to default as similar loans made in the same neighborhoods by independent mortgage originators not subject to the law nonetheless we make the following observation about government housing policies they failed in this respect as a nation we set aggressive homeownership goals with the desire to extend credit to families previously denied access to the financial markets yet the government failed to ensure that the philosophy of opportunity was being matched by the practical realities on the ground witness again the failure of the federal reserve and other regulators to rein in irresponsible lending homeownership peaked in the spring of 2004 and then began to decline from that point on the talk of opportunity was tragically at odds with the reality of a financial disaster in the making when this commission began its work 18 months ago some imagined that the events of 2008 and their consequences would be well behind us by the time we issued this report yet more than two years after the federal government intervened in an unprecedented manner in our financial markets our country finds itself still grappling with the aftereffects of the calamity our financial system is in many respects still unchanged from what existed on the eve of the crisis indeed in the wake of the crisis the us financial sector is now more concentrated than ever in the hands of a few large systemically significant institutions while we have not been charged with making policy recommendations the very purpose of our report has been to take stock of what happened so we can plot a new course in our inquiry we found dramatic breakdowns of corporate governance profound lapses in regulatory oversight and near fatal flaws in our financial system we also found that a series of choices and actions led us toward a catastrophe for which we were ill prepared these are serious matters that must be addressed and resolved to restore faith in our financial markets to avoid the next crisis and to rebuild a system of capital that provides the foundation for a new era of broadly shared prosperity the greatest tragedy would be to accept the refrain that no one could have seen this coming and thus nothing could have been done if we accept this notion it will happen again this report should not be viewed as the end of the nations examination of this crisis there is still much to learn much to investigate and much to fix this is our collective responsibility it falls to us to make different choices if we want different results

have received a darwin award for sure p head typetitledear sirhead pi am writing in response to your request for additional information in block 3 of the accident report form i put poor planning as the cause of my accident you asked for a fuller explanation and i trust the following details will be sufficient am a bricklayer by trade on the day of the accident i was working alone on the roof of a new sixstorey building when i completed my work i found i had some bricks left over which when weighed later were found to be slightly in excess of 500lbs rather than carry the bricks down by hand i decided to lower them in a barrel by using a pulley which was attached to the side of the building on the sixth floor securing the rope at ground level i went up to the roof i swung the barrel out and loaded the bricks into it then i went down and untied the rope holding it tightly to ensure a slow descent of the bricks you will note in block 11 of the accident report form that i weigh 135lbs due to my surprise at being jerked off the ground so suddenly i lost my presence of mind and forgot to let go of the rope needless to say i proceeded at a rapid rate up the side of the building in the vicinity of the third floor i met the barrel which was now proceeding downward at an equally impressive speed this explains the fractured skull minor abrasions and the broken collarbone as listed in section 3 of the accident report form slowed only slightly i continued my rapid ascent not stopping until the fingers of my right hand were two knuckles deep into the pulley fortunately by this time i had regained my presence of mind and was able to hold tightly to the rope in spite of the excruciating pain i was now beginning to experience at approximately the same time however the barrel of bricks hit the ground and the bottom fell out of the barrel now devoid of the weight of the bricks that barrel weighed approximately 50 lbs i refer you again to my weight as you might imagine i began a rapid descent down the side of the building in the vicinity of the third floor i met the barrel coming up this accounts for the two fractured ankles broken tooth and severe lacerations of my legs and lower body here my luck began to change slightly the encounter with the barrel seemed to slow me enough to lessen my injuries when i fell into the pile of bricks and fortunately only three vertebrae were cracked i am sorry to report however as i lay there on the pile of bricks in pain unable to move i again lost my composure and presence of mind and let go of the rope and i had to lay there watching the empty barrel begin its journey back down onto me this explains the two broken legs i hope this answers your inquiry p head typetitledeep thoughts from comedian steven wright head pa

 ussrsos some new information has come to light over the kursk disaster for those with short attention spans the kursk was the submarine that blew up and sank in the arctic ocean killing all 118 on board the russians tried to blame the incident on a collision with an unidentified object however sonar tapes which recorded the blasts a small one at first then a much larger one two minutes later cast doubt on these claims a whistleblower within the russian military has leaked that the crew of the kursk was testing a new type of torpedo when the accident occurred it seemed very likely that the test didnt go quite as planned while rescue efforts to save the survivors of the kursk failed salvage crews were able to recover a black box from the submarine which recorded events leading up to the explosion as luck would have it we managed to obtain a copy of those tapes it turns out that the submarine crew was trying to load microsoft windows on their fire control computer their intent was to replace the aging cpm operating system with the flashier windows os apparently the russians didnt know about the legendary stability problems exhibited by windows the log tapes make this painfully obvious captain is the new fire control windows os installed yet seaman almost sir we just need to finish filling out the registration card captain excellent soon we will be able to point and click

dangerous yes grass snakes not rattlesnakes a couple in sweetwater texas had a lot of potted plants and during a recent cold spell the wife was bringing a lot of them indoors to protect them from a possible freeze it turned out that a little green garden grass snake was hidden in one of the plants and when it had warmed up it slithered out and the wife saw it go under the sofa she let out a very loud scream the husband who was taking a shower ran out into the living room naked to see what the problem was she told him there was a snake under the sofa he got down on the floor on his hands and knees to look for it about that time the family dog came and coldnosed him on the leg he thought the snake had bitten him and he fainted his wife thought he had a heart attack so she called an ambulance the attendants rushed in and loaded him on the stretcher and started carrying him out about that time the snake came out from under the sofa and the emergency medical technician saw it and dropped his end of the stretcher thats when the man broke his leg and why he is in the hospital the wife still had the problem of the snake in the house so she called on a neighbor man he volunteered to capture the snake he armed himself with a rolledup newspaper and began poking under the couch soon he decided it was gone and told the woman who sat down on the sofa in relief but in relaxing her hand dangled in between the cushions where she felt the snake wriggling around she screamed and fainted the snake rushed back under the sofa and the neighbor man seeing her laying there passed out tried to use cpr to revive her the neighbors wife who had just returned from shopping at the grocery store saw her husbands mouth on the womans mouth and slammed her husband in the back of the head with a bag of canned goods knocking him out and cutting his scalp to a point where it needed stitches an ambulance was again called and it was determined that the injury required hospitalization the noise woke the woman from her dead faint and she saw her neighbor lying on the floor with his wife bending over him so she assumed he had been bitten by the snake she went to the kitchen brought back a small bottle of whiskey and began pouring it down the mans throat by now the police had arrived they saw the unconscious man smelled the whiskey and assumed that a drunken fight had occurred they were about to arrest them all when the two women tried to explain how it all happened over a little green snake they called an ambulance which took away the neighbor and his sobbing wife just then the little snake crawled out from under the couch one of the policemen drew his gun and fired at it he missed the snake and hit the leg of the end table that was on one side of the sofa the table fell over and the lamp on it shattered and as the bulb broke it started a fire in the drapes the other policeman tried to beat out the flames and fell through the window into the yard on top of the family dog who startled jumped up and raced out into the street where an oncoming car swerved to avoid it and smashed into the parked police car and set it on fire meanwhile the burning drapes had spread to the walls and the entire house was blazing neighbors had called the fire department and the arriving firetruck had started raising his ladder as they were halfway down the street the rising ladder

refer of course to the automatic monthly deposit of my entire salary an arrangement which i admit has only been in place for eight years you are to be commended for seizing that brief window of opportunity and also for debiting my account with 50 by way of penalty for the inconvenience i caused your bank my thankfulness springs from the manner in which this incident has caused me to rethink my errant financial ways you have set me on the path of fiscal righteousness no more will our relationship be blighted by these unpleasant incidents for i am restructuring my affairs in 2000 taking as

 the entrepreneur is the new madonna dear joe i know what you mean about being a journalist almost every assignment is a challenge in a different way and it never seems to get easier i often feel as if i only get half the story sometimes so i typically do a massive amount of reporting that is most often much more than i will ever need i think that is why i welcomed doing a bookit gives one the ability to use so much of what is left on the cutting room floor of daily journalism think of all the good stuff we all collect daily in our reporting that we never add to stories most often reporters recount these tales with each other and with their sources rather than share them with the general public much of it of course using the standards of top newspapers cannot be used since it is largely gossip we are repeating although it certainly could make for some very good stories i often wonder when a really great fictional book will be written about this era probably decades and decades hence as it is too close in any case there certainly is no lack of information available about the moguls of technology now as they all become our current pop icons i would posit that bill and michael and steve and jerry have become the madonnas of the current age of stock market mania and celebration of the entrepreneur so the shift in the image of gates has been an interesting one for me to watch the smartboy technologist is now being painted as the whiny bully i personally always thought it was a risk to pin the image of microsoft on just one manat aol for example there was a conscious effort to develop other characters for lack of a better word so there while you think of case you also think of pittman and leonsis and increasingly a range of other executives steve ballmer of course is now getting a lot more attention at microsoft but it still seems to be bills show over there while i did not attend the triali was lucky to be able to read your highly amusing and informative dispatches several of which made me spit up my lunch laughingit certainly seemed as if the image of bill gates took a beating and the insular culture of microsoft did not look so good thats ironic since i think it was just that insularity that helped them much in the same way that aol has benefited from being in the virginia suburbs rather than in silicon valley aol would never have existed if it had been founded here i am sure since its employees would have been mocked into obscurity by the digerati out in the dc area they looked positively exciting next to all the governmentoriented contractors i wonder if that means geography is destiny and its still location location location from where i am sitting i think the microsoft trial has been the really obvious turning point between the computer era and the digital age i think it almost does not matter what the judge does since its clear that the balance of power is shifting again although it not clear where it will land will the strongman of the era be aol att microsoft or one of the big media companies or will it be none of them because the internet allows and encourages a plethora of strong companies and a complex interconnection of businesses where none are allowed to dominate i always use two simple words when people tell me that one companywhether it is aol or microsoft or disneyis in charge of all our destinies babylon was that incredible empire dominated the world and i imagine it did not seem possible to people living then that anyone could loosen that empires grip on humanity but we all know how that story turned out now i am getting way too philosophical but this is my final missive so why not perhaps you could hasten a prediction of where this is all going as for me ill stick with my philosophy of reporting and i guess lifenobody knows cheers kara

 stephanopoulos analyzes his own crime there was former clinton aide george stephanopoulos on abcs this week this morning furrowbrowed and heartbroken with all the evidence coming out against the president last week when the lewinsky story was only a few hours old stephanopoulos popped up on good morning america to demonstrate his concern these are probably the most serious allegations yet leveled against the president theres no question that if theyre true they could lead to impeachment proceedings is chatterbox alone in thinking there is something strange and even disgusting about stephanopoulos eager show of independence from the president the problem isnt so much his disloyalty political figures turn on each other from time to time for good and bad reasons were used to it stephanopoulos wants to run for the senate and doesnt want to seem a clinton stooge by lending credence to the lewinsky charges and treating clintons familiar defenses as the lies and halflies they seem to be stephanopoulos shows hes not a fool the trouble is that stephanopoulos himself helped propagate those lies in the first place during the 1992 campaign when gennifer flowers first brought clintons philandering to public attention stephanopoulosas clintons chief spinner distracter and allaround bullshit artistplayed a crucial role in discrediting flowers and anyone else who tried to point out the truth namely that clinton had a disturbing zipper problem dont say stephanopoulos didnt know again hes not a fool simply put stephanopoulos did as much as any man to get the country into the mess he now so telegenically laments the 1993 documentary the war room captures some of his efforts on tape early in the film with the flowers crisis in full bloom sam donaldson interviews stephanopoulos who blames it all on the republican attack machine gov clinton has no character problem stephanopoulos declares donaldson suggests that on 60 minutes clinton had admitted to infidelity he said he had problems in his marriage says stephanopoulos correcting donaldsons deviation from the prescripted fudgephrase of the day today of course the presidents defenders claim that clinton admitted infidelity on 60 minutes and that the fully informed voters simply didnt care near the end of the war room stephanopoulos gets a call from someone who apparently claims to have a list of clinton paramours which he is about to publicize stephanopoulos skillfully bullies and cajoles him into keeping quiet you would be laughed at he tells the caller i guarantee you that if you do this youll never work in democratic politics again nobody will believe you and people will think youre scum you might say that stephanopoulos helped invent the philanderprotection techniques that seem to have made clinton so overconfident of his ability to not get caught he was one of clintons principal enablers to use a word employed by maureen dowd in todays new york times when democrats wonder why there is so much resentment of clinton they dont need to look much further than the big lie about philandering that stephanopoulos carville and a cooperative campaign press corps helped to put over in 1992 now the dissembler and enabler has become the scholar and abc news analyst its as if roy cohn went on television in the mid50s to soberly rue the damage wreaked by sen joe mccarthy without any apology for his own role much has been made of the way famous wrongdoers eg dick morris marv albert rebound too quickly in our celebrity culture but usually at least a nanosecond of contrition is required stephanopoulos is cashing in without even going through the minimal motions of holding himself accountable for misleading the country if clinton as is now increasingly clear was a time bomb waiting to explode then stephanopoulos helped smuggle him into the white house and muffled the ticking 
 selling land to jews last week a 70yearold palestinian realestate dealer was murdered after he violated a new edict by the palestinian authority making the sale of arabowned land to jews a capital crime the issue of land sales has a long history as a subtheme of the jewisharab struggle the 19 th century jewish intellectuals who conceived of zionism the idea that jewish survival depends on the establishment of a jewish state in the biblical land of israelnever worked out their ideologys logistics jewish settlement in palestine then part of the decaying ottoman empire only proceeded piecemeal in the 1880s and 1890s about 25000 jews immigrated to palestine most integrated into multiethnic communities in the cities of jaffa tiberias and jerusalem a second wave of 30000 immigrants came between 1905 and 1914 many of whom were labor zionists who wanted the jewish state to be socialist extolling the virtues of manual labor they acquired huge tracts of farmland from absentee syrian and lebanese landlords the new palestinian jew they said needed to be physically tougher than the brainy shopkeepers who had been trampled in europe the jewish national fund was founded in 1904 for the purpose of buying up land from arabs after the ottoman empires defeat in world war i britain acquired palestine and promised in the balfour declaration the creation of a jewish state in anticipation jews in palestine began laying the groundwork for a greater sense of national identity the jewish national funds charter was amended to mandate that jewish land could never be resold to arabs or opened to nonjewish employees following jewish national fund guidelines farmers evicted palestinian peasants living on the newly acquired plots the total number displaced was small by 1946 jews owned only 7 percent of palestine but the perceived threat of displacement was widespread among arabs starting around 1910 arab newspapers railed against jewish land acquisition among the peasantry rumors spread alleging an anglojewish conspiracy to remove muslims from palestine anxious to avoid being blamed for palestinian landlessness british officials began imposing token restrictions on jewish land purchase in 1940 they publicly supported arab complaints that jews were driving arabs off the land palestinians say evictions destroyed their way of life forcing them to move from rural palestine to crowded cities in search of work they also say that the bettereducated jewish buyers had duped illiterate peasants into selling property the arab national fund created in 1931 by wealthy arab families to purchase land for displaced peasants was ineffective during the 1930s palestinian responses turned violent in 1934 jerusalems mufti the spiritual leader of the citys muslims decreed that believers were duty bound to murder other muslims who sold land to jews arabs who outnumbered jews by more than 2to1 revolted against jewish land acquisition and british promises of jewish nationhood about 5000 arabs and several hundred jews were killed in riots and guerrilla attacks between 1936 and 1939 zionists argued that the land purchases benefited all the territorys residents jewish immigrants introduced modern agricultural technology which increased productivity and helped fill the markets with food to feed the growing arab population zionists also maintain that jews became a lucrative market for arabmanufactured goods some historians trace palestinian landlessness to palestines entry into the world economy in the 1880s urban commerce drew some peasants from their family farms other subsistence farmers found themselves competing with cashcrop entrepreneurs jews and arabs whose successes changed the face of palestinian agriculture jewish land purchases were not the primary factor these historians say very little of the land owned today by individual jews and the israeli government was acquired by purchase jewish sovereignty and ownership were established the way these things usually are by war israel confiscated all land owned by the british government mostly desert and mountains after the 1948 war of independence property owned by arab refugees who either fled war zones or were forced from their homes by the israeli army another longstanding controversy was also taken over by individual jews or confiscated by the government many palestinians however stayed put retained their land and became israeli citizens a new school of jewish historians is more critical of the dislocations caused by jewish land acquisition and concludes that it was not always fair one popular theory compares zionisms imperative to acquire land to the american idea of manifest destiny that it was the united states godgiven right to rule from coast to coast others argue that it was a mistake for the jewish national fund to prohibit nonjewish laborers from the newly purchased lands however even these revisionists agree that the jews had not intended to evict muslims from palestine israeli security officials believed that the murdered realestate dealer was executed by plainclothes palestinian authority police the palestinian authoritys decision to make the sale of land to jews a capital crime reflects palestinian frustration with israeli land use specifically the creation of a new jewish neighborhood now under construction in east jerusalem in the past death threats have done little to deter sales of land according to british land records the jerusalem muftis 1934 decree failed to prevent sales but that decree did not have the power of civil law behind it nevertheless the incentives to sell at the market price are substantial and if the threats create new scarcities higher prices will probably encourage sellers to unload their land 
 fetal viability viability has become the focus of the abortion debate last week the senate rejected majority leader tom daschles bill banning the abortion of viable fetuses but william bennett and william safire hailed daschles bill as the great compromise that might settle a quarter century of arguments about abortion fortyone states already restrict the abortion of viable fetuses what is a viable fetus how is the concept of viability relevant to the moral and legal issues of abortion roe vs wade the 1973 case legalizing abortion made fetal viability an important legal concept the supreme court ruled that states cannot put the interests of a fetus ahead of the interests of the pregnant woman until the fetus is viable the court defined viable to mean capable of prolonged life outside the mothers womb it said this included fetuses that doctors expected to be sustained by respirators the court accepted the conventional medical wisdom that a fetus becomes viable at the start of the last third of a pregnancy the third trimester sometime between the 24 th and 28 th week a pregnancy usually lasts 38 weeks because the point of viability varies the court ruled it could only be determined case by case and by the womans own doctor even if the fetus is viable the court said states could not outlaw an abortion if the womans life or health was at stake justice sandra day oconnor argued in a 1983 decision that roe was on a collision course with itself she said that improvements in technology would continually push the point of fetal viability closer to the beginning of the pregnancy allowing states greater opportunity to regulate the right to an abortion and this seems to be the caseup to a point doctors now believe a fetus can become viable during the 23 rd weeka week earlier than was thought 24 years ago most hospitals will only perform abortions through the 22 nd week of pregnancy but no baby has ever been successfully delivered before the middle of the 22 nd week babies delivered during the 22 nd and 23 rd weeks weigh just over a pound their lungs have barely formed and their airways are not developed enough to inhale circulation depends on the use of ventilators and injections of hormones a baby born during the 22 nd week has a 148 percent chance of survival and about half of these survivors are braindamaged either by lack of oxygen from poor initial respiration or too much oxygen from the ventilator neonatologists predict that no baby will ever be viable before the 22 nd week because before then the lungs are not fully formed probability of survival increases for babies born later in pregnancy 25 percent in the 23 rd week 42 percent in the 24 th week 57 percent in 25 th week by the 30 th week when a newborn doesnt require a ventilator to breathe it has a 90 percent chance of survival and only after the 30 th week do the risks of longterm brain damage begin to substantially subside because premature babies depend on technology survival rates vary based on access to that technology for instance in rural communities which commonly lack expensive infant intensivecare units survival rates in these early weeks are much lower doctors assess a fetuss viability by attempting to guess whether its lungs have formed sonograms allow doctors to estimate the fetuss weight which correlates with the lungs development and to look for signssuch as the development of functioning eyelids and creases in the skinthat coincide with the onset of a functioning respiratory system none of the methods for predicting viability are very precise despite important supreme court decisions since 1973 modifying the doctrine of roe the courts thinking about fetal viability has remained fairly constant the only significant revision came in the casey decision 1992 which made viability even more important the court said that state laws could require a woman and her doctor to perform tests to prove that a fetus is not viable before she obtains an abortion fortyone states now have laws restricting postviability abortions some allow doctors to decide for themselves if the fetus is viable some require doctors to perform tests to prove a fetus is previable and require multiple doctors to certify the findings eleven states have banned the procedure called intact dilation and extraction idealso known as partialbirth abortion in the belief that this procedure is used mainly postviability banning ides nationwide is a major goal of the prolife movement movement adherents claim that the ide procedurein which delivery is induced the fetuss skull is crushed and its brains are suctionedamounts to infanticide barring this procedure is also the only regulation of abortion that publicopinion polls say has a majority of support prochoicers say the ban on ides is inconsistent with roe because the procedure can be used to abort previable fetuses some medical ethicists and constitutional scholars say that the supreme court was wrong to create the previabilitypostviability distinction in the first place why they ask does the fact that a fetus can survive outside the womb with the help of vast medical technology change either of the interests at war in the abortion debate the fetuss own claim to humanness and a womans right to control her body even if viability is an important moral line is it drawn in the right place keeping alive a baby born in the 22 nd week costs several hundred thousand dollars and usually fails regardless of the effort the fuss over postviability abortions ultimately concerns only a very small number of procedures less than one percent of all abortions performed take place after the 21 st week in 1992 only 1070 abortions were performed after the 25 th week 
 red pants while writers whose business it is to be witty often fail to produce grave authors occasionally are mirthful when laughter is farthest from their minds from a lifetime of undisciplined reading with innocent pencil in hand and malice prepense in mind i have gleaned a harvest of what i am pleased to denominate red pants items a sampling of which follows my designation derives from a splash of vivid writing in francis thompsons a corymbus for autumn in which he proclaims how days dying dragon was panting red pants into the west in this trousers category thompson must share the limelight with coleridge by virtue of the line in kubla khan as if this earth in fast thick pants were breathing even shelley may stake a claim if only in the pajama division of this sector thanks to his description in epipsychidion of how the slow silent night is measured by the pants of their calm sleep since everthing is to be found in shakespeare it is not surprising that on at least two occasions the board has contributed his own red pants nuggets in antony and cleopatra act iv scene viii lines 14 et seq antony commands the wounded scarus to leap thou attire and all through proof of harness to my heart and there ride on the pants triumphing and in othello act ii scene i line 80 cassio utters the fervent prayer that othello might make loves quick pants in desdemonas arms a variation on this theme occurs in alba de cspedes the secret translated from the italian by isabel quigly simon and schuster new york 1958 page 114 where she confides that i still had a whole afternoon before me to spend and i used it to tidy up my drawers one may well wonder what miss stowe had in mind when in uncle toms cabin chapter 5 she narrates how mrs shelby stood like one stricken finally turning to her toilet she rested her face in her hands and gave a sort of groan in this same vein the mirthless milton adds his bit to the general hilarity of nations when in describing mount etna in book i of paradise lost lines 2367 he penned and leave a singed bottom all involved with stench and smoke and in chapter vi of vanity fair when blenkinsop the housekeeper sought to console amelia for joe sedleys jilting of her dear rebecca thackeray confides indelicately that amelia wept confidentially on the housekeepers shoulder and relieved herself a good deal chuckles often emanate from the british employment of a term in a sense at variance with american usage there is that oftquoted example near the opening of trial by jury where defendant asks is this the court of the exchequer and having been assured that it was defendant aside commands himself to be firm be firm my pecker the british of course do not giggle at this bit of gilbertian dialogue since to them pecker means courage as in the phrase to keep your pecker up two of the more common examples of britishamerican divergence of usage are screw and knock up in vanity fair chapter 39 the niggardly sir pitt was not nearly the aerial acrobat your american sophomore might fancy him to be when he screwed his tenants by letter he was simply making extortionate exactions upon his wretched lessees similarly when in chapter xxxiv of the same novel mrs bute reminds her husband that youd have been screwed in goal bute if i had not kept your money she was not speaking of pleasures deferred in bleak house chapter xxvii grandfather smallweed referring to mr george warns mr tulkinghorn that i have him periodically in a vice ill twist him sir ill screw him sir in kiplings the light that failed chapter xiii torpenhow urges dick to attend a party that night we shall be half screwed before the morning is his dismal sales pitch to dick in chapter vi of vanity fair thackeray reports on joe sedleys drunken avowal to wed becky sharp the next morning even if he had to knock up the archbishop of canterbury at lambeth in order to have him in readiness to perform the ceremony in great expectations chapter vi we learn how mr whopsle being knocked up was in such a very bad temper and who could blame him many a raucous snigger has been sniggered from the pureminded use of a word that suggests unmentionable parts of the human body it does not take a toowicked mind to read into such terms meanings of a lewd nature who can for instance blame a youth with but a mildly evil disposition from guffawing when he

though he is sure that isak dinesen did not intend an impropriety when she recorded in out of africa part v chapter 4 how fathimas big white cock came strutting up before me and one is certain that kenneth rexroth in his american poetry in the twentieth century herder and herder ny 1971 did not intend to hint at closet biographical matter when in chapter i he wrote that whitmans poems are full of men doing things together or later in the same chapter when he referred to whitmans joyous workmen swinging their tools in the open air college freshman still read with flendish glee the first line

picturesque are the references to erections an arresting one occurs in a passage to india chapter xxi in which forster describes a small building as a flimsy and frivolous erection while in the mayor

let down when he learns that a whinger is but a whinyard which is merely a short sword turning a corner of the mazza gallerie into a womens tennis store i was startled to see hordes of giggling high school girls from an article by dorothy gilliam in the washington post submitted by light refractions if you are a fan of oldfashioned jazzwhat is now known as traditional or trad jazzyou are familiar with one of the standard jump tunes of the genrea tune most commonly called muskrat ramble even if you are not a fan you must have heard it as least a dozen times it is the one that goes dah dah dah dah dadatdatdah dadedadedadedatdatdah dadedadedadedatdatdah thats it sure youve heard it i think i first bought a recording of muskrat ramble back in about 1940 when i was in my early teens my memory is rickety but i am sure my first recording was labeled muskrat ramble and i think though i am less sure that it was played by the late muggsy spanier who was to my mind one of the greatest of jazz trumpeters later i got another recording of the same tune this one by i think mezz mezzrow the label said muskat ramble i thought that was surely the first time i had ever seen such an obvious typographical error in of all things a simple title on a simple 78rpm record this remember was in my youth and it was a time when typographical errors were called typographical errors not typosat least by kids in junior high some time later i got still another version of muskrat ramble with still another version of the title this time it was muscat ramble that i thought was really absurd not only had they left out the r theyd changed the k to c now it made no sense at all on the other hand i reasoned if there were in fact some sort of cat called a muscat perhaps it wasnt so outrageous i looked up muscat in my websters and found that it is a variety of grape to name a ramble after a variety of grape seemed to me preposterous i was young and by todays standards at least pathetically innocent during my time in senior high and after that in the army air force i had other things on my mind there was a war on after all and i didnt give the muskratmuskatmuscat ramble problem any thought speaking of my time in the aaf which was utterly undistinguished i think i must make a confession now might be as good a time as any to reveal a theft i committed at an air force base near seymour indiana it was winter and bitterly cold the wind used to sweep across that damned airfield with what seemed an absolute determination to crystallize our bodies one day when the wind chill factor was nearing absolute zero i took shelter in the service club there was the omnipresent phonograph or vic short for victrola and the stack of records next to it in those days people as a rule did not take much care of phonograph records usually the records were taken from their jackets and loaded naked in stacks where they picked up dust scratched one another and traded static electricity i was shuffling through a stack of about fifty records and i came across three bessie smiths i played all three and the few other gis in the room which was quite largebig enough for a fairsized dance with a small orchestraeither paid no attention or asked me to put on something by glenn miller or jimmy or tommy dorsey instead among bessies numbers were dying gamblers blues sing sing prison blues and one i had never heard called black mountain blues which has the imcomparable lines home in black mountain a chile will smack yo face home in black mountain a chile will smack yo face babies cry for liquor an all the birds sing bass and goin back to black mountain me an my razor an my gun goin back to black mountain me an my razor an my gun goin cut him if he stan still goin shoot him if he run i was and still am captivated by babies cry for liquor an the birds sing bass and in the arrogance of my youth i was certain that nobody else on the airfield either knew or cared who bessie smith was nor would any other gi be enchanted by basso birds so i turned thief i cant remember how i did it but somehow i smuggled those records back to my barracks and got them home intact on my next furlough i kept them in good shape until my last 78rpm turntable died end of digression and back to muskratkatcat muskrat ramble is credited to edward kid ory and ray gilbert kid ory played great jazz trombone the only thing i know about gilbert is that i find him listed as coauthor of muskrat ramble about thirty years ago when i was concocting an epicurean dish and saw that i had no sherry on hand i went to the liquor store and bought a bottle of muscatel that was being sold for an absurdly low price and that i thought might be exactly right for my sauce it wasnt bad the wine jogged my thoughts back to muscat ramble muscatel is made from muscat grapes is sometimes called muscat and being relatively cheap and sweet and high in alcohol content is the booze of choice for a great many wines an old college friend of mine who celebrated his twentieth birthdaymeaning twenty years of aa sobrietya couple of years ago tells me that when he was on the skids and riding the rails from drunk tank to drunk tank the favorite terms for muscat were muscadoodle and napa valley smoke i made up my mind that muscat ramble was almost certainly the original name of the tune my reasoning is that it is not likely that kid ory or ray gilbert had ever seen a muskrat and its even less likely that they or anyone else has ever seen a muskrat doing anything that we would be likely to think of as rambling muskrats according to my encyclopedia look like giant rats are found in and around the mudbanks bordering marshes and quiet ponds have partially webbed feet and do a good deal of swimming they do not appear to do much rambling muscat or muscatel on the other hand is found on skid rows all over the land a guy with a bottleshaped brown paper bag damp and wrinkled at its upper end has almost certainly been slugging down a sweet wine of high proof and the odds are pretty good you would find it is a muscadoodle after the guy finishes his napa valley smoke and has slept it off he is looking for the means to get another muscat fix now he is on a ramble with his hand out and a pleading look in his roadmapped eyes i suspect that that is precisely the songs origin my theory is that the r got put in there simply because muskrat is a more common word than muscat it is the same reason most of us i assume have heard hes in the hospital with prostrate trouble prostrate is a more common word that prostate so prostrate is what we get the r fits in naturally i got a strange sort of corroboration from my good friend rosy mchargue who is now pushing eightyseven years and has spent most of his life playing clarinet and sax with some of the best jazzbandsbenny goodman red nichols ted weems and a slew of others rosy too had seen the tune as muskrat muskat and muscat i asked him what he thought the original title was he had known kid ory well and he said you know tom im not exactly sure i once asked ory about it and he said its muscat muskrat so i think thats just the way everyone said muscat there you are i find a muskrat ramble difficult to imagine visually i picture muskrats wallowing about in the mire and paddling sluggishly through the water but i wouldnt call that rambling on the other hand a wino with an empty paper bag on a ramble to maintain his muscat levelnow that has a touch of poetry maybe not in the same class with all the birds sing bass but poetry

master antipodean newsletter leonard bloomfield having begun with a theory of meaning which emphasized the environment in which objects were present and named had to add the obvious proviso that we sometimes mention what is not present i have lately been reading accounts of the exploration of the western and northwestern deserts of australia in the 1870s and i have become very aware of the effect absent necessities might have on the frequency of particular items in discourse in the desert the missing necessity is water as the explorer ernest giles put it the explorers experience is a baptism worse than that of firethe baptism of no water my impression was that in the journals of desert explorers the word water alone or in compounds and words relating to water were unusually frequent it is i suppose likely that people with little money must think of money more than the welloff do and that the hungry will dwell on thoughts of food and the thirsty on drink here was a chance to quantify such things i decided to make a count of words relating to water in reports of desert exploration taking quite at random a single page page 7 in the journals of the gregory brothers recording an early 1846 exploration of country east and north of perth i find the word water used fifteen times ten pages on page 17 water occurs nine times but there are also the related words stream twice well twice pool channel and the circumlocution essential element two words dew and shower refer in the context to the presence of water the rest are in contexts indicating its absence i tried another explorer ernest giles taking page 17 again i was reminded that giles is rather given to semiserious poetic diction at times and we find him referring to the presence of water in the finke river as the stream purling over its stony floor or quoting some bygone poet brightly the brook through the green leaflets giddy with joyousness dances along perhaps present water called for some stylistic celebration two hundred pages further on there is less exuberance in the circumlocution that fluid so terribly scarce in the region and in three other references water is simply water giles is not always waxing poetic and may like other explorers be useful as a source for the history of australian and general english his use of the word tank to refer to a hollowedout reservoir gibson dug a small tank and the water soon cleared antedates the oed for instance since this linguisticstatistical study of an obsession might well prove to be an important contribution to psycholinguistics i decided to make a larger sample of watery words choosing the straightforward journals of colonel peter egerton warburton who led an expedition across the western interior of australia in 18734 in a randomly chosen sequence of ten pages 15160 of the published journal there were twentyeight occurrences of the word water eight of them in compounds no page being without at least one example in addition there was a rich collection of words relating to water not necessarily indicating its presence hoping to find a lake is included though of course it doesnt indicate the presence of water even words which are usually of more general reference are brought into relation with water in a text like this gumtrees or rocks in areas of sand appear as signs of possible water apart from these words and lake words and phrases directly associated with thoughts of water and reinforcing the sense of obsession include pool springs drainage hole clay hole flood channel watercourses waterhole rockhole drink drinkable running water stream and native well the last two items merit comment stream is often said not to be used in australia except in metaphorical ways normally being replaced by creek warburtons use sandbanks intercept the stream which finally splits into narow watercourses and spreads itself over the plains and so it ends as a creek suggests a somewhat more complex relation between the two words britishborn explorers did not set out to write australian english of course gregory uses stream in the way normal in england giles consistently refers to gens in the hills of central australia though glen is not current outside placenames in contemporary australian english the other name native well is as a later explorer david carnegie author of spinifex and sand 1898 points out a misnomer he believes native wells are essentially rockholes depressions in rock buried in fairly shallow sand which when hollowed out by the natives appear to be wells this sort of misnomer leads carnegie to suppose that to the uninitiated no map is so misleading as that of west australia where lakes are saltbogs without surface water springs seldom run and native wells are merely tiny holes in the rock yielding from 0 to 200 gallons carnegie also describes nammaholes and soaks as sources of water soaks are shallow wells sunk near the base of an outcrop to tap an underground reservoir nammaholes have been variously described to carnegie they are depressions on the surface of rocks often with a rounded bottom where stones are often found suggesting that the stones have something to do with the formation of the holes some nostalgic early australians deplored the loss in our speech of english country words the glens and streams alive anyway in the journals of explorers coppices and brooks woods becks and rivulets perhaps these words did not really fit we might have done better with arabicspeaking settlers wadi for instance would describe an inland creek

feminist writings may find it useful and interesting to consider a book recently published in britain that is typical of the harsher brand of such works the work in question offers nothing regarding language so its review here is ancillary to the main function of verbatim the feminist movement is very much alive in britain and the greenham common women are probably largely responsible for much of the national sentiment against the cruise missiles installed at an american base near that village in britain as elsewhere most books by feminist writers are reviewed by women usually feminists men are seldom assigned to review them possibly because the editor fears that they will be either ignorant of or unsympathetic to the issues raised if not biased against them or because the editor is a woman because writing an unfavorable review of a bad feminist book would be tantamount to treachery such books are often unjustifiably praised as was the case with this work by rosalind miles which was well received on its publication in june according to the blurb on the dust jacket of this distinctly unpleasant book rosalind miles is head of the centre for womens studies at coventry polytechnic a lecturer broadcaster journalist and author of several other books including a highly acclaimed biography of ben jonson one might like to believe that this gives her the cachet of authoritative scholarship but the text does not bear out the promise for the most part the book consists of a rewriting of history from the dawn of time with the purpose of demonstrating two main themes the fact that women were responsible for all the important contributions to the advancement of civilization as the development of agriculture for instance often despite the arrogance and stupidity of men and the fact that women have long been subjected to domination by men miles suggests that such domination is a recent phenomenononly a couple of thousand years oldfor she points to the clear superiority of women in primitive religions and matriarchies right on through to the egyptian dynastic rulers at one point she gets so carried away with her thesis that she suggests that females were responsible not only for all of human evolutionary biology but for the very notion of counting in order to keep track of menstruation and probably by the same token astronomy she quotes and presumably accepts another source which holds that woman first awakened in humankind the capacity to recognize abstracts if you believe that balderdash youll believe anything in the good old days we were taught that the pyramids were built by tens of thousands of slaves recent speculation has it that they were not slaves butwhat would one call them ordinary laborers here comes miles authoritatively quoting diodorus the greek historian who recorded 6030bc that innocent women even swelled the ranks of pitiful slaves whose forced labour built the pyramids bound in fetters they work continually without being allowed any rest by night or day they have not a rag to cover their nakedness and neither the weakness of age nor womens infirmities are any plea to excuse them but they are driven by blows until they drop dead p49 as the pyramids were already about 2500 years old when diodorus wrote his world history one is given to wonder what his authority might have been for such a vivid description it is even less comprehensible how a modern researcher could accept it and have the effrontery to promulgate it miless book is riddled with many similar distortions convenient omissions and generalizations women have always commanded over half the sum total of human intelligence and creativity from the poet sappho who in the sixth century bc was the first to use the lyric to write subjectively and explore the range of female experience to the chinese polymath pan chao ban zhao who flourished around ad 100 as historian poet astronomer mathematician and educationalist the range is startling in every field women too numerous to list were involved in developing knowledge and contributing to the welfare of their societies as they did so the roman fabiola established a hospital where she worked both as nurse and doctor becoming the first known woman surgeon before she died in ad 399 p52 earlier on page 49 we learnt about agnodice who lived to become the worlds first known woman gynaecologist in the fourth century bc clearly this rosily checkered past was soon to be replaced chiefly it seems as judeochristianislamicconfucianbuddhist cultures flourished it was not too bad early on when according to miles the seven maccabean martyrs who saved judaism did so only at the instigation of their mother miles continues in early christianity likewise women found not merely a role but an instrument of resistance to male domination in choosing to be a bride of christ they inevitably cocked a snook at lesser male fry thousands of young women helped to build the church of god with their body blood and bones when frenzied fathers husbands or fiancs preferred to see them die by fire sword or the fangs of wild beasts rather than live to flout sic the duty and destiny of womanhood p63 but the situation soon deteriorated even st paul later the unregenerate prophet of female inferiority was forced to acknowledge the help he received from lydia the seller of purple dyes in philippi ibid this rewriting of history is punctuated by an array of fourletter invectives applied to males and by adjectives like brilliant unusual inspiring and so forth to women citing a judaic lawbook of the 16th century which identified a woman for the days preceding during and following her period as niddah impure miles has the lack of taste to write the following as a final stroke in a grim foreshadowing of what the future held in store for the jews the niddah had to wear special clothing as a badge of her separate and despised status p83 here and there in this morass of misunderstanding miles treads on solid ground if one can agree with the eminent anthropologist joseph campbell campbell known for his extensive analyses of the worlds mythologies religions and cultures noted the marked bias against women emerging from judaic concepts later reinforced by christian and islamic doctrine most of the religions of the world connected woman with mother earth fertility and all the other progenetic and nurturing associations and this was borne out in the cultures of the people according to campbell the only godlike female figure in the bible is the virgin mary and she appears identified as virgin only in the gospel according to luke as luke was a greek campbell suggested that mary was a carryover from the paganism of the ancient greek pantheon although this might help explain the judeochristianmuslim tendencies to subjugate women treating them essentially as chattel it does not account for a similar treatment accorded them in other cultures notably that of japan it is not entirely clear whether campbell was commenting on hinduism buddhism etc as they once existed conceptually for it is unlikely that he could have ignored the treatment of women in the modern reflexes of the cultures adhering to those religous precepts campbell held that the ancient mythologies and religions are allegorical and that there was no real distinction between gods and goddesses who were given sexual identity when in human form only to make them more meaningful with all respect that seems a highly debatable issue and one far too complex for this discussion though we can certainly trace a diminution in the role of female divinities or divinity when we come to examine judaism and its congeners and progeny other debatable aspects are the questions of whether the debasement of women is a reflection of the theology or the ritual whether the scripture of any religion should be understood allegorically or literally and so forth if there is something wrong it behooves us to get at the roots of the problem not to flail about wildly for only after the source of a disease has been identified can one properly investigate its cure history according to rosalind miles blasts away at the symptoms in a misconceived notion that alleviating them will effect a cure of the disease in this jeremiad males are viewed as the enemy and are so characterized throughout the book which concludes with exhortations to engage the foe and a strident call to arms though not mens laurence urdang archaeology language a verbatim book club selection just when you thought it was safe to assume that we now know all we are ever likely to know about the past someone digs another hole and unearths literally or figuratively some ancient artifact one day it is a fragile scroll found in a cave near the dead sea that turns out to be prebiblical the next day it is an entire terracotta army of chinese soldiers the next it is a skull excavated from the olduvai gorge that compels anthropologists once again to revise their guesses about the earliest stages of homo sapiens sapiens vs hominids most of the relies from the past are gone forever destroyed by the plows of countless generations of farmers reduced to rubble by erosion by conquerors by prehistoric and modern urban developers by fire and flood and just by time many we may hope have not yet been found the interest in mans forebears did not become fashionable upon the publication a few years ago of roots on a far larger scale we have been trying to discover all we can about the origins not of men but of man strange to say however that interest does not seem to be more than a few hundred years old if the ancient greeks and romans the indians the chinese and other peoples were curious about their own prehistory i have not heard of it perhaps the fascination with mans past grew out of the obsession with ruins evinced by romanticism certainly modern archaeology seems to have followed close behind for the excavation of the supposed site of troy took place only about 100 years ago perhaps it is just as well for only by the means available to modern science are we now able to preserve some of the artifacts that we find and through radiocarbon dating determine their approximate age archaeology is a popular pursuit and its manifest results not only receive considerable publicity but can be seen in museums not so paleolinguistics or the reconstruction of ancient languages even the remnants we have from early languages that had a writing system are relatively sparse classical latin and greek hebrew and a few other languages are better documented than others but for most all we have to go on are a handful of tablets here a few inscriptions there barely enough in many cases to allow us to identify the language let alone draw any conclusions regarding its structure or meaning perhaps one day we shall find an etruscan library buried deep in the italian countryside but for the present we have to make do with what we have which is precious little about languages that had no writing system we know nothing at all but some very clever comparative linguists beginning in germany in the 19th century theorized about how the nature of the ancestors of the more modern tongues in some instances ancient languages have been decoded some from multilingual inscriptions the work of jean francois champollion 17901832 in deciphering hieroglyphics from the rosetta stone was an astonishing accomplishment for it enabled us to read the myriad writings of the ancient egyptians on papyrus and in wall inscriptions and revealed an enormous amount of the knowledge we have today about their civilization which lasted for about 2600 years another significant breakthrough was that of michael ventris 19221956 who deciphered the linear b script found on crete and identified it as an early form of greek from the standpoint of language ventriss work was more important particularly because it filled in a gap in our knowledge of the early states of indoeuropean languages many years ago a linguistic scholar counted all of the languages then spoken of which he had evidence the total was approximately 2800 but that is probably only a vague estimate he undoubtedly missed some some have sprung up since his time modern hebrew for instance and some have vanished the exact count is unimportant and at best spurious for it is extremely difficult to establish uniform criteria for what distinguishes dialect from language then too one must examine the techniques used to group the many languages of the world linguists examining classical greek latin german english slavic swedish norwegian danish dutch lithuanian iranian hindi and the other languages of india and europe found that there were correspondences among many of the common words some like french spanish italian and portuguese had more in common with one another than they did with say german english swedish danish and dutch which in turn bore only a remote resemblance to russian and polish on the one hand and the two extant varieties of say gaelic on the other one rapidly runs out of hands and must resort to fingers and toes for after years of laboriously categorizing these languages the number of different main branches called families and subfamilies came to about ten ingeniously certain differences between families were explained by various phonetic shifts that inexplicably took place in one language group but not in another although certain other languages were geographically nearby it was impossible to establish any resemblances between them hence basque for example is not classified as being in the same family with other european languages nor are hungarian and finnish both of which belong to their own group at the conclusion of this vast exercise done without the aid of computers there emerged a pattern of familial relationships that linked together languages spoken in earlier times from britain as far east as chinese turkestan and from india as far north as lappland charts showing the chief languages and their derivations can be found in many dictionariesinside the front cover of the random house unabridged for example because linguists are constantly learning more and more about the relationships among languages it is best to avoid using an older chart for the same reason it would be wise not to stake too much on the accuracy of even a current chart the languages discussed here are what are usually called the indoeuropean family similar family trees could be drawn for the semitic languages sinotibetan japanese bantu malayopolynesian and so on each is a distinct phylum although there may be wordborrowing among them lexicon is considered less important in the classification of languages than structure and grammar it is important too to note that writing systems are irrelevant for instance polish is written today using the roman alphabet but russian a related slavic language uses the cyrillic yiddish a germanic language is written in hebrew characters latin greek and sanskrit which resemble one another rather closely in some respects all use different alphabets and early examples utterly unrecognizable to untrained readers of modern languages were written in cuneiform quite suitable for writing on soft clay tablets with a pointed stylus and hieroglyphics it would be nice to think that while linguists were working so hard to organize languages they were working alongside the archaeologists who were providing the raw materials but only rarely did they collaborate and with few exceptions their work was not correlated in a systematic way schliemann who discovered the site of troy used the evidence in homers iliad to determine his digging site where any ruins had long since disappeared from view in many other places the ancient sites lay buriedand still dobeneath modern cities modern property owners quite understandably take a dim view of tearing down their buildings on the off chance that the remnants of an ancient town will be found several yards below today before a new building is erected in london an archaeological team examines the cleared site for its archaeological significance but there as everywhere else nothing can interfere with progress and regardless of the finds and their importance the archaeologist must eventually yield to the bulldozer notwithstanding even the brief glimpses afforded by such investigations can provide some insight into civilizations that existed hundreds or in some cases thousands of years earlier based on the sparse evidence available linguists theorized about the earlier languages that had given rise to those attested in other words based on what they knew about a group of languages which were documented they tried to imagine the language that they sprang from in most cases they dealt with words and functional elements creating what are called reconstructions in hypothetical family prototypes called variously protolatin protogreek protogermanic protoindoiranian and so forth the ultimate goal being to posit a single language called protoindoeuropean that is not entirely true for linguists know too much about language to suggest that there ever was literally a single language from which all indoeuropean languages descended nonetheless it is convenient to think about the existence of a group of protodialects which can be referred to as protoindoeuropean it seems only natural that once an original language or ursprache was posited the next step was to speculate on its source or urheimat that is what renfrew has tried to do essentially he proposes that the parent of all indoeuropean languages was itself born in central anatolia whence it spread eastward westward and northward being modified by the influences of the languages with which it came into contact till it ultimately emerged in its recognizable modern manifestations which we categorize into germanic hellenic italic indoiranian anatolian armenian celtic tocharian albanian and baltoslavic i have no quarrel with renfrews theorynotwithstanding the generally received wisdom that has placed the homeland north of the black sea region and the volga steppes it is difficult for the nonspecialist reader like me to assess the validity of his arguments which are based on his contention that the language and its congeners were carried along by the spread of nomad pastoralism using the evidence available renfrew contends that the original indoeuropean language closely related to hittite separated after 6500 bc with the ie languages of western europe developing from western anatolia and those of iran india and pakistan from the eastern division the choice between the prevailing theory and renfrews depends on whether one accepts a wave theory first promulgated more than a hundred years ago by johnanes schmidt a german linguist or one of indigenous development pottery finds can be interpreted to support either the imposition of an elite culture from turkmenia or a late development of the indus civilization renfrew accepts the wave theory and in the last two thirds of archaeology language he sets forth his arguments in its favor unfortunately the presentation of his linguistic argument where the author is clearly treading on more speculative ground than in those parts dealing with outright archaeology where he is on more familiar territory is disorganized and repetitious it is difficult to place all the blame on renfrew for his editor should have noticed the lack of coherence the result is an argument that is persuasive but scarely convincing nevertheless good books on archaeology assimilable by laymen are not easy to find and if the reader can tolerate its shortcomings and is not overly concerned about the precise birthplace of indoeuropean archaelogy language provides an interesting march through the millennia of prehistory in sevenleague boots laurence urdang websters electronic thesaurus this software consists of two disks one labeled installation and program the other synonym linguibase and a manual the manual sets forth everything with clarity and the program is simple to install requiring only a few minutes only one thing made me a little suspicious when cranking up the system in the descriptive text that appears on the screen the word labeled is spelt labelleddecidedly unamerican however i went ahead and since i was typing the text you are reading returned to the beginning of the paragraph to see how some of these words would fare i looked up the word preceding and was after a brief moment asked to type in the word which i did the screen bloomed forth with the following query preceding 1 adj being before especially in time or arrangement there were also some other parts of speech one definition for the preposition and three for the verb participial senses i called up the synonyms for the adj and the following appeared synonyms antecedent anterior foregoing former past precedent previous prior the way the program works is this one uses the cursor to highlight a particular word for which synonyms are desired it is similar in principle to finding a synonym in a synonym dictionary and then looking up its synonyms to find them i am not sure why but i expected the program to network in the same way however when i highlighted antecedent what appeared on the screen was the same list of synonyms but with antecedent missing and preceding had reappeared if all this is too complicated to follow let me summarize you look up word x and get synonyms a b c d e f and g you look up the synonyms for word a and you get synonyms x b c d e f and g even the definition provided for the sublistings is identical in wording to that of the word originally sought this is very economical of space and involves a clever computer ploy but it does not provide a particularly useful synonym dictionary for as we all know synonymy in language does not yield to the commutative law of mathematics in language things equal to the same thing are not necessarily equal to each other perhaps the proximity people thought that they had got round that little problem by giving the same definition for each of the items in the list but we know that only very rarely are two synonyms biunique which is another way of saying that if a b b does not necessarily always equal a an ineluctable fact of language if a relatively limited access to a synonym dictionary is likely to be of use then this package may be of service it works with a hard disk or with a set of floppies and can be used with 29 popular wordprocessing programs that was the number listed when i received my copy it might have increased it also has a few neat features like suggesting a few alternatives if you happen to think that preceding is spelt preceeding as many people do it has a useful help feature that can be called upon at any stage also if you enter jump you get the synonyms for that but if you enter jumped you get the same synonyms but inflectedincluding the variants leapt leaped for leap all in all for a relatively primitive system it is not too bad but you would have to be in love with your computer to use it in preference to a far more complete books of synonyms available especially the synonym finder rodale in the us and canada longman elsewhere which offers more than 800000 synonyms more than three times the number listed in any other synonym book the blurb on this bookdisk package reads supplies you with 470000 true synonyms for 40000 entries my guess is that such a quantity might be reached if one counted all the permutations and combinations in reality though there are probably far fewer actual words

addisonwesley reading ma 01867 not to verbatim laurence urdang a midwesterner will hays jr who is proud of his knowledge of postcivilwar history tells me the following origin of shot as in shotglass absent from gunning for the english language although we associate trench warfare with world war i trenches were characteristic also of the civil war a scaffold was built so that a rifleman who fired a singleshot muzzleloading shoulder weaponcould step up and shoot over the top of the trench the soldier in charge would command after each firing that the rank on the scaffold step down and be replaced by the rank that had just reloaded thus alternating ranks and sustaining the rifle fire that war like others produced disgruntled veterans and those more adventurous or more restless after military service they moved westward to start a new life the population increased markedly with corresponding demands for goods and services among them the need for saloons most new saloons were small and the bars short accommodating with difficulty the many bunched up in ranks if you will calling for whiskey many of the thirsty crowd were veterans as were many of the bartenders thus step down or

after reading the article definitions under pet end with petting party coll a gathering for the purpose of caressing as an organised sport origin unknown not from gaelic i think it hardly fanciful to discern a note of calvinist disapproval in this curt disclaimer although i greatly enjoyed richard lederers article i fear that one of his paragraphs is a load of brass monkey balls the monkey on board ship was a lad employed to fetch suppliespowder and so forthto the guns the word might also have been used for a receptacle near the guns where powder and balls were kept however this receptacle would have taken the form of a wooden box or something similar the idea of a metal stand carrying a pyramid of cannon balls so delicately balanced as to be affected by the tiny differential expansion of brass and iron does not bear thinking about in a heavy sea so what is the explanation of the phrase cold enough to freeze the balls off a brass monkey well the obvious one i believe anybody who asks why a brass monkey is probably not aware that brass monkeys were very common household ornaments in england in the 19th and early 20th centuries originally they were probably imported from india but were later massproduced in places such as birmingham to grace victorian and edwardian mantelshelves they can still be found today in socalled gift shops usually they come in sets of three one with

english class a very discomfited student after frantic and obtrusive dictionary work handed a colleague of mine a scrap of paper on it was written this sentence please make me go to the bathroom you could look it up as everyone in the world must know by now william safire writes a column in the new york times magazine called on language considering the circulation of the new york times on sundays his column is probably the most widely read commentary on contemporary english in the world that places more than one uncommon burden on a writer he must do his utmost to be accurate he must try to select subjects likely to be of interest to his readers and he must write well those familiar with safires editorial style reflected in his political columns on the editorial pages of the n y times may agree with me in the contention that when he writes about language he seems to be writing on his day off i cannot put my finger on why but on language always strikes me as an excruciating effort to be cute in part that is attributable to the designation of his correspondents who keep him informed on language that is not within earshot as the lexicographic irregulars an amusing reference the first time or two it was used but now beginning to cloy more often than it might prove of interest to me personally safire deals with insiders language in washington where he is based or with trivialities uttered by some politico as andrew norman wrote in a letter published in this book on page 113 you flit freely back and forth between prescriptivism and descriptivism but are not many of us guilty of that we are descriptive of the usages we accept and prescriptiveperhaps proscriptive would be more descriptiveof those we do not like at least safire expresses an opinion whether the reader agrees with him is another matter as are the questions of his accuracy which arise fairly often and that of the suitability of his style which as far as i know has not been broached before it ill behooves me excoriated recently as enamored of the cheap larf to criticize safires arch puns which permeateenliven is probably the word his editor would usehis articles but i find some kinds of humor unsuitable for reading however they might evoke a chuckle when uttered viva voce a handful of examples from the book at hand therefore i stand uncorrected p 112 get your hand off my knee thats a

sawed offp 123 but the library of congress wants to be nonu in its spelling of logue words ibid writing containing such labored figures makes for hard reading i am interested in what safire has to say about language but find myself stymied i get the feeling that he has deliberately created a minefield of interruptions in thought through which i must pick my way to the end notwithstanding the valuable role he plays in inspiring nonlinguists to think about language and in informing them about myriad facets of the subject i find it hard slogging or as he would probably write sloguing you could look it up is the umpteenth collection of safires columns and like the previous collections contains a selection of letters from readers it is those that are so sorely missed in his column true there is an occasional mention in his column of a point raised by a correspondent and the letters section of the magazine prints a comment from time to time but an important feature of the books is their inclusion of far more writerreader interaction than one might suspect from reading the column alone for one thing the letterwriters call attention to errors or misinterpretations and are largely critical safire cannot be accused of being copyproud except evidently of awful puns as in ms is deliberately msterious but at least it is not deliberately msleading and other mscegenations there is no gainsaying that safire is one of the most influential writers on contemporary english and it is essential that his books be in the libraries of all who are interested in the subject regardless of their alignment with his opinions for one thing he documents many neologisms an activity that endears him to many working lexicographers from the sometimes cavalier manner in which he treats his subject one wonders if safire feels the burden of the responsibility he has toward his readers the publisher sent unrevised bound proofs from which this review was prepared unfortunately there was no proof of an index but the publisher has assured me that there will be one in the published book a rather essential ingredient of a work with this title laurence urdang websters new world guide to current american usage here is a commonsense style book useful to those who have the education and common sense to be in doubt about questions of english usage it has some problems if you want to be sticky about things on p xv we read einsteins special theory of relativity does not say that e mc and in leap year mc indeed it does not but it does say e mc the version with the capital m and c is essentially meaningless to those familiar with the conventional symbolism used in physics while i acknowledge that it is not easy to know how to sort out the many topics to be covered in a usage book most reasonable writers have taken a stab at writing an entry under a heading that seems a likely place to look then have provided a detailed index not bernice randall true one can find different from etc in an entry so headed but for absolute constructions one is referred to an entry called covered with onions relish and ketchup i ate a hotdog at the ballpark if the user wants to find out about misplaced adjectives and adverbs reference is made to the entry electric shaver for women with delicate floral design on the handle a search for only would be futile perhaps the subject and treatment of usage need some lightening up but i am hard put to agree that they are quite as frivolous and lightheaded as this book would have us believe fun is fun but those who might rely on such a book are quite serious about the information they are seeking and it is unfair to play fast and loose with their sincerity a sense of humor about a subject is born of a feeling of security about it but security is the one characteristic often lacking among those who would use current american usage there is no doubt that randall enjoys her work but of what use is a long entry on spoonerisms and of what use are the interminable examples for instance of the misuse of like for as which draw out the entry to three pages more than four pages are devoted to clichs under the guise of lo and behold its mans best friend which being an exclamation really ought to end in an exclamation point the article on britishamerican english theres no home like eaton place is a good one but at six pages its utility is questionable in the matter of pronunciations of breng names it is an oldfashioned fantasy of americans that brits go round saying pomfrit for pontefract most brits that i have heard give the name a spelling pronunciation these days and so with many of the old shibboleths of what relevance to usage notwithstanding the fact that the topic is interesting is an entry on eponyms john bull and john hancock are not just any johns that is not strictly speaking a subject pertinent to the title of the book all of which is to say that the book is an interesting work on the language and contains accurate though longwinded information about what it covers interesting and useful facts about american english its only real faults are its title which belies the content the cutesy headings and the lack of a truly detailed index selfindexing does not provide coverage of sufficient detail as a reference work on usage it is far from complete the simon and schuster publicity department could have used an entry on foreword forward spelt foreward in the release accompanying the review copy a longish section some troublesome idiomatic prepositions and a glossary of grammatical and

herrings readers should be familiar with robert claibornes earlier books especially our marvelous native tongue the life and times of the english language one might say that subtitling the present book a book of lost metaphors is an example of a loose canon sic unless metaphor is taken in its broadest sensebut one is unlikely to find red herrings here the etymologies of a few hundred words and phrases are given many not readily findable in standard works of reference the rationale behind referring to them as lost arises from the authors observation of an unfortunate state of affairs because of an increasingly widespread lack of familiarity with the basic structural elements of our culturegreek and roman mythology the bible literature and ordinary historical factpeople today are unable to discern the origins of terms like aphrodisiac achilles sic heel or tendon meet ones waterloo sow dragons teeth and handwriting on the wall to name a few there are many of course but unaccountably they are not the focus of this book claiborne investigates and reports on expressions like sow ones wild oats about which he tells us little or nothing the modern latinate designation avena fatua came too many centuries after the original expression to have any relevance to it so why bring up the information that fatua is latin for foolish it was also latin for wild which might be more to the point in any event it is hard to discern from the arch style affected in an attempt to make dull facts interesting just what is the origin of sow ones wild oats in many entries claiborne labors the obvious offering little or nothing we do not already know could easily imagine or for which the author offers no explanation among examples of the first are spit and polish on the spot on the square stick ones neck out etc examples of the last include spill the beans square the circle stalemate etc between these is an occasional flash of useful wisdom much of it pretty well covered by other books of this type which seem to be proliferating what is missing for example at square the circle is the information that because the area of a circle is mathematically calculated using pi which is irrational there is no mathematical way of calculating the dimensions of a square with the same area as that of a given circle but that does not mean that such a square cannot exist as for stalemate which is related to checkmate would it not have been important to indicate that the mate part has nothing to do with english having been borrowed from checkmate which is a loanword from persian and has nothing to do with check either often an entry offers nothing in the way of etymology and merely explains the meaning does any reader need an entry like this one straddle when you straddle a horse youve got one leg on either side of the animal when a politican straddles an issue hes in much the same position some speculative suggestions as the derivation or reinforcement from seidlitz powders for take a powder are sheer nonsense not all entries contain misleading dull or incorrect information but those that do not are marked by a lack of originality laurence urdang word maps dialect geography a branch of dialectology describes certain features of the dialects of a language and their distribution the field is about 100 years old most prominent among its earliest practitioners in england was joseph wright who prepared the sixvolume english dialect dictionary which was published between 1898 and 1905 the bestknown contemporary british specialist is harold orton in america work proceeded space during the 1930s largely under the direction of raven mcdavid hans kurath and later harold allen more recently lee pedersen and others have investigated american english dialects between 1948 and 1961 fieldworkers based at the university of leeds conducted the survey of english dialects which studied 313 localities in england which as everyone ought to know does not include wales or scotland the present book is extracted from the two major works that resulted from the survey the linguistic atlas of england 1978 and a word geography of england 1974 both under the direction of harold orton aided by sanderson and widdowson in the latter effort people generally seem to find dialect study interesting one letter writer to the times 21 june 1988 reported our close neighbour in bere regis who was born in the village and who speaks with a delicious dorset burr always uses i instead of me well it makes company for i and company for she another of his happy expressions is innerwards meaning since as ini chucked him out the door and hes not been back innerwards another reported same date lets get it right the bristol for me is not i but oi when i was teaching there the explanation invariably given by boys brought to me for scrapping in the playground was ee it oi so oi it ee the 100 maps selected for representation from the survey yield information on several hundred words some of which are clear variants others quite different lexical entities for instance map 34 shows the areas marked off by boundary lines where the variants chimley chimbley chimmock chimdey chimbey and chimney occur map 33 shows the distribution of child most of southern england and of bairn north of a slightly wavy line between boston on the wash to the east and lancaster on the west coast the authors have provided a brief introduction which is easy to follow a list of suggested readings and the names and addresses of the several institutions and societies in britain where readers may indulge a more intensive interest in dialect study the maps are clear each occupying a full page and the word information is well set forth on them where necessary brief but not cryptic explanations are provided of any information that might seem to be out of the ordinary i have only one nit to pick with the authors in their description of isoglosses they write these are drawn to run midway between localities which were shown by the survey of english dialects to use the different words or pronunciations which are the subject of the map although it is true that isoglosses in effect set off the various areas where a particular usage was recorded more accurately an isogloss is drawn to connect sites either where speakers employ both usages or where speakers using one or the other live in very close proximity hence the term isogloss from iso same gloss word to describe the line on a map where the terms are of equal distribution isoglosses are to dialect maps what isobars and isotherms are to weather maps what isobaths are to geophysical maps of the oceans etc the authors are not alone in getting this wrong it is incorrect in some dictionaries in those countries where dialect study is undertaken dialectologists observe that there are today many factors militating against the strict maintenance of older dialect boundaries the standardization of terminology as adopted by national periodicals news services radio and television the establishment of prestige dialects and through the media their promulgation and the huge population shifts that have taken place particularly in the us since wwii such shifts have been somewhat slower in england but seem now to be speeding up there are many other lesser factors at work but taken together all tend toward standardization especially as the older speakers die off in some respects it may not be long before certain aspects of dialect geography will be largely historical the importance of dialect is emphasized regularly in the press where we read about people being killed as in parts of india because they use the wrong shibboleths this book is a good introduction to the subject in england those familiar with dialectology in america and those interested in the study in england or indeed generally would be well advised to add word maps to their libraries laurence urdang american literary almanac this is an interesting useful reference book containing information about the betterknown writers of america it is divided into eighteen chapters varying in length each dealing with a different aspect of the authors and their works among them writers related to writers schooldays which colleges and universities spawned which writers american literary pseudonyms american literary title sources literary cons hoaxes frauds and plagiarism in american literature the profession of authorship authorspublishers editorsagents thrown to the wolves reviews and reviewers these are supplemented by an extensive bibliography and a detailed index as can be seen from the chapter headings some of the material is trivial but nonetheless interesting for that it is not at once apparent why the book is styled an almanac but that is unimportant there is no other book i know of that contains as much diverse information about american writers as this one its readability and organization make it suitable for browsingeven for reading straight throughso in that respect at least it does not resemble books in the oxford companion series it contains many photographs of writers some quite early these enliven the appearance of the book but accomplish little else unless one is interested in what samuel clemens looked like at the age of 15 as a printers devil or in the appearance of hart crane standing in the middle of a railroad track in cleveland in 1916 it is difficult to make any sensible connection between the lives of authors and their creations a handful might have led colorful existences some are objects of interest because they died early committed suicide were related to other famous people and so forth but such information seldom reveals as much about their output as do the creations themselves and in certain cases one is probably better off not knowing quite so much this book appears to have been diligently researched and has much to recommend it as an adjunct to most libraries public and private large and small general and specialized laurence urdang faculty protest against apartheid at cornell tv news tease whec rochester submitted by the tenor brings the

 november 15 1994 dear think of your greatest accomplishments think of the joy and success they bring to you and your loved ones michael sims felt that way at age 39 the day he earned a job michael was born with cerebral palsy upon entering the work force he discovered few job opportunities that seemed to match his abilities for several years he performed packaging and clerical work his most recent job lasted only a year before cutbacks eliminated his position for 18 long months michael could not find a job he resorted to public assistance dollars to survive finally michael called goodwill at goodwill michaels counselors felt that his personable demeanor could be a major attribute and identified for him a possible jobmatch where his people skills could shine after three interviews michael proved that he was the right person for the job as the clubhouse monitor at bent tree apartments he now provides customer service for 50 to 60 tenants each night at last he has found success in a job that he loves now his goals are set on moving up in the company every year thousands of people come to goodwill like michael they share two common characteristics they face some barrier to employment and they want to work with support from people like you they can overcome their barriers and earn success and the selfsufficiency that comes with it and then the payoff begins for the entire community individual successes at goodwill mean fewer persons receiving public support and more paying taxes last year participants in goodwill programs earned and paid taxes on wages of nearly 35 million their successes at work also saved taxpayers more than threequarters of a million dollars in public assistance the savings are counted in more ways than dollars and cents however the families of the new wage earners may feel the accomplishment in terms of a house to live in money to purchase food without food stamps and the beginning of a family focused on success not hopelessness wont you help make all of these successes possible please send the largest contribution you can comfortably make your gift will help give new meaning to the word success for people who have seldom had reason to use the word sincerely james m mcclelland president ps your gift will make a difference for every dollar of public support goodwill received last year we returned 159 to the community in the form of earned wages and reduced public assistance payments

 january 5 1997 name address city st zip dear bill this is the time of year when our thoughts turn to ways to do things differently things that will make our lives better and improve the quality of our life as you begin that process this year i would like to ask you to consider helping young people in marion county toward more positive youth development by becoming a supporter of the marion county commission on youth inc mccoy inc originally founded as a government agency but reorganized in 1993 as an independent notforprofit is a countywide youth services coordinating planning and convening agency its purpose is to encourage collaboration and cooperation between the various agencies programs and systems that serve our communitys youth in addition to that behindthescenes role mccoy has taken an outfront role in developing a summer bus pass neighborhood youth councils and the we value youth information line it is our goal that every young person in marion county have access to the programs and services that can best assist them in their growth toward a positive adulthood i am hopeful that you as an individual and meridian insurance as a corporation might consider becoming sustaining supporters of mccoy i have enclosed a packet of information about mccoy and its work as well as an application with various options for supporting the youth of our community i obviously cant tell the whole story of mccoy in a single letter but i hope this provides an overview of the scope of our work i will call you in a few weeks to discuss your level of interest please consider joining together with your fellow citizens in support of the work of the marion county commission on youth sincerely john brandon executive director 
 october 7 1996 name address city st zip dear name in the summer of 1993 the marion county commission on youth began what can best be described as a new era in its history mccoy was reorganized as an independent notforprofit agency separate from local government it retained however the same mission with which it had been charged from its inception to serve as a catalyst for effective coordinated and collaborative service delivery to youth in our community for the past three years mccoy has been actively engaged in accomplishing this declared mission in cooperation with many others youth service providers youth funding bodies and interested citizens to name a few we have met with a number of successes along the way most notably the summer fun line the metro summer bus pass and the development of ten neighborhood youth councils a providers council and a youth coalition are building relationships that will hopefully bear great fruit in the years to come the formation of the community academy a pilot project directed at expelled students from local school systems has come about as a result of mccoys efforts to mobilize community agencies in response to a pressing issue mccoy is actively represented and working with numerous community collaborations where we regularly raise our voice to speak out for the inclusion of young people in both decisionmaking and program planning processes one concrete example is a joint project undertaken in the united northwest area in partnership with the junior league of indianapolis and community partnerships with youth from fort wayne indiana as a team these three organizations are working with neighborhood youth and adults to build a caring neighborhood with youth mobilizing the assets of young people and adults as partners to build a better neighborhood for all since its reorganization mccoy has established its unique niche within the community by refraining from direct service programming and focusing on what it does best helping to identify youth needs convening groups of individuals and organizations which can address those needs and moving toward collaborative solutions mccoy has only one interest the well being of marion countys young people mccoy invites the support of the company foundation in the amount of 1000000 to support such activities as the coordination of youth leadership training and youth empowerment efforts at the neighborhood level by means of neighborhoodbased youth councils the promotion of youth employment opportunities the facilitation of ongoing discussions regarding effective and efficient youth service delivery the provision of technical assistance and guidance to neighborhoods which seek positive youthadult relationships the development of communitywide supports for the positive growth of all marion county young people in the last several years the business and corporate community has recognized that the positive development of youth is directly related to the development of a competent workforce youth who are supported and encouraged by both a family and a society that values them have a much greater likelihood of becoming productive and contributing members of adult society while we have made significant inroads there remains much to be done and it is clear that we cannot do it alone we seek the financial support of the foundation to help us be successful in creating the atmosphere in our community where young people can grow and develop well your contribution will enable us to both continue and expand the good work we have begun in making indianapolis a city famous for its commitment to youth and families in our fund raising efforts to date we have received the support of local government foundations and corporations as well as the personal financial commitments of individual mccoy board members we believe there is no more appropriate time to have a coordinated and collaborative effort to financially support the services mccoy offers to the community as a whole thanking you in advance for your support we remain sincerely john t neighbours philip b roby president treasurer john f brandon executive director

 im outraged and i think you will be too just imagine finding your favorite hiking trail or birding area littered with dead birds among the hundreds of thousands of unsuspecting and innocent creatures who were unlucky enough to consume lethal doses of a slowacting poison spread in fields miles away and who plans to commit such a mass bird killing the us department of agriculture in fact the usda has plans to spread poisoned rice in sunflower fields throughout the northern great plains targeting two million migrating blackbirds and threatening nearly 70 other bird species its almost unthinkable that a program this reckless could be implemented in view of the tragic impact that poisonous chemicals and pesticides like ddt have had on wildlife and people thanks to the help of caring and concerned people like you audubon won a temporary halt to this planned killing last spring but the usdas plans could be up and running for the next blackbird migration unless we act now let me tell you exactly whats at stake and how this could set a dangerous precedent first of all you might wonder why blackbirds are not benefiting from the migratory bird treaty acts prohibition against actions that cause intentional harm you see the usda found a loophole allowing these protections to be lifted for experimental activities so they applied for the right to spread poison as dart of a scientific experiment to learn whether lowering the population of blackbirds by poisoning them will reduce sunflower crop loss can you believe it the usda wants to conduct an experiment that will spread enough poison in our environment to kill two million blackbirds and if the death of two million birds doesnt prove their theory and show a reduction in crop loss theyll likely seek the right to kill even more birds the next year its time to tell the usda in no uncertain terms you will not conduct massive bird kills to benefit a handful of special interests because the usdas slowacting pesticide takes three days to kill its victims will likely fly many miles from the poisoned fields before falling to the ground meanwhileblackbirds arent the only birds threatened directly by the poison weve noted the presence of 68 other species of grassland songbirds in the proposed poisonbaited areas including the bobolink grasshopper sparrow harris sparrow and le contes sparrow in all nine birds on the federal threatened or endangered lists and 11 birds on audubons watchlist of imperiled species could be found in these killing fields we simply cannot afford to let the government repeat the mistakes of the past and operate this deadly and uncontrolled experiment on wildlife heres what i need you to do to make sure we prevail first i need you to sign and return your petition to the us secretary of agriculture ill forward your petition along with those from thousands of other audubon members and supporters urging the usda to withdraw its cruel plan to poison blackbirds in favor of alternative benign methods of protecting sunflower crops i can assure you that thousands of audubon petitions can make a difference just as they did in a successful battle against an adverse wetlands proposal a few years ago but todays battle is one we must win to block a dangerous experiment that would begin to erase 50 years of steady progress eliminating pesticides and other harmful chemicals from our environment thats why i hope youll also agree to help even more by making a taxdeductible gift to support this crucial initiative and all of audubons vital conservation work to protect birds other wildlife and habitat and with a donation of 15 or more youll receive a free birdfeeder in appreciation for your concern ill make sure your gift is put right to work in our efforts to win a ban

 alaska emergency dear defender look closely at this photo and youll see a wolf running soon this wolf wont be merely running in the snow this wolf will be running for its life the airplane above will be tracking her in order to land and immediately gun her down you see the alaska legislature passed a law that once again allows any private citizen with just a 15 trapping or 25 hunting license to track wolves by aircraft and then land and gun them down this cruel unethical wolfhunting practice is called sameday airborne landandshoot it was a total shock and surprise in may the alaska legislature voted to reinstate sameday airborne wolf killing frankly we never thought alaskas antiwolf politicians would go this far but they did overriding governor tony knowles veto and ignoring the will of the majority of alaskas citizens unfortunately this practice will begin after the first snow this september when wolves will be cantmiss targets against alaskas snowy terrain wolves can run fast but they certainly cant outrun airplanes given the urgency of the situation in alaska defenders needs your immediate assistance to help save alaskas wolves from sameday airborne landandshoot slaughter support the emergency effort to save alaskas wolves defenders hopes to raise at least 100000 to help alaskans for wildlife a coalition of alaska citizens win a citizens ballot initiative this november and we face very wealthy opponents so today i urge you to do these two things first sign the enclosed citizens advisory ballot to show our alaska allies your strong personal support to reinstate the ban on sameday airborne landandshoot wolf killing in alaska second rush an urgent donation to help put this measure on the ballot and win passage in november the alaska legislature is completely out of step with the will of alaskas citizens and the american public at large like you the majority of alaskans oppose sameday landandshoot wolf killing but the antiwolf politicians in the alaska legislature dont care what the majority of alaska citizens want and they didnt listen to the recommendations of the alaska department of fish and game which opposed this legislation they are utterly out of step with their alaska constituents the state agency that manages alaska wildlife and the rest of the american public in the name of wolf control wolf killers will predictably once again use aircraft to hunt wolves to the point of exhaustion so that the wolves have literally no chance of survival and if history is any guide over the years thousands of alaskas wolves will be brutally killed before the 1996 ban on sameday landandshoot as many as 400 wolves were killed in alaska each year because of this barbaric and unethical practice antiwolf interests are prepared to spend hundreds of thousands of dollars to make sure that the new landandshoot law stands even though most alaskans do not support it so if we dont act right now alaskas snowy tundras will once again become bloody killing fields for wolves in americas last frontier say no to the barbaric practice of sameday airborne wolf killing the only way alaskans can repeal the new law and reinstate the ban on sameday airborne landandshoot wolf killing is with a citizens referendum thats why your special financial support is so important and urgently needed alaska wolf advocates need your immediate support to save wolves as i mentioned this new sameday airborne landandshoot practice will start in september after the opening of hunting season and the first snow and when wolves will be an easy target to repeal this unconscionable law defenders must help provide our friends in alaska alaskans for wildlife with the resources necessary to win at the polls in november our wellfunded opponents will spend whatever it takes to mislead and confuse voters about this ballot measure we need help to supplement the funds raised by alaskans for wildlife for careful polling the development of voter education spots for television radio and newspapers the placement of those ads and getoutthevote efforts on election day if alaskas new law is not replaced thousands of alaskas wolves will die in the years to come and it will be a major setback for wolves nationwide at a time when the american public overwhelmingly favors wolf reintroduction and protection a loss will encourage those antiwolf fanatics who want to stop wolf restoration and put bounties on those wolves already in the wild so please dont wait another minute please sign your citizens advisory ballot to demonstrate to our alaska allies that youre behind them and send an urgent donation today to help them win this effort so how will your money be spent heres the projected budget breakdown 35000 indepth statewide survey conducted by a top pollster to determine voters positions on the ballot measure and arguments that will help persuade undecided voters 45000 salaries office expenses for staff to oversee the effort between now and election day 30000 production of television and radio spots alerting the public to the findings of the above survey 100000 placement of voter education spots in the key media including print radio and television money must be in hand by midaugust to reserve time for september and october 15000 election day getoutthevote drive including phone calls to get voters to the polls you stood by defenders when we defeated the wealthy american farm bureau in court and saved the lives of the wolves in yellowstone national park and central idaho now im hoping i can count on your moral and financial support again today to help save alaskas wolves from sameday airborne landandshoot killing your special donation today is absolutely critical because many of alaskas politicians clearly have antiwolf agendas they have the financial backing of powerful special interests and the determination to ignore the will of the people of alaska and the american public please let alaskans know that youre behind them let them know you share their concern about protecting alaskas wolves please help save alaskas wolves by doing these two things 1 sign the enclosed citizens advisory ballot to show your support for repealing sameday airborne landandshoot wolf killing in alaska 2 rush a special donation to help our alaska allies overturn this odious new law remember for this emergency effort to

hsus are very important to the wellbeing of all animals because together we can prevent suffering and save lives i wish i could tell you that everyone is concerned about protecting earths animals dogs cats farm animals and wildlife the sad truth is animal cruelty abuse and neglect continues at an alarming rate across the nation and even in your own community every day of the year the humane society of the united states receives reports about all kinds of animal cruelties such as the horrors of the leghold trap the use of dog and cat fur needless or repetitive experiments on animals and the abusive treatment of dogs and cats still others are less obvious but just as horrible dogs fighting to the death for the benefit of blood thirsty gamblers baby calves confined and malnourished to provide milkfed veal for the gourmet and the accidental drowning of porpoises in the nets of tuna fishermen and almost 6000000 companion pets are put to death in shelters throughout america what is even more shocking is that more than 30 million animals die these cruel painful deaths each year needless deaths that could have been stopped and with so much animal cruelty and suffering going on im sure you can understand why the work of the humane society of the united states is so vitally important and why we need the support of many other people like you to help us bring an end to animal suffering abuse and neglect since 1954 our programs and activities have been aimed at stopping and eliminating all animal abuse and we continue to spend a great deal of time investigating animal cruelty cases and working with the courts to prosecute the guilty parties we also work hard and lobby for better animal welfare laws at the local state and federal government levels and we insist they enforce existing laws to prevent animal cruelty our primary goal though has always been to stop the cruel and inhumane treatment of animals before it happens so we teach the public about the need to protect all animals from suffering abuse and exploitation but while our programs and activities have been successful in reducing animal cruelty we are constantly faced with new problems of animal suffering which need immediate attention and drain our resources its a difficult problem because we have to fight the wellfinanced and powerful agribusiness and research industries but we do our best to protect the animals right now the problems are mounting and we need all the help we can get to stop animal cruelty and thats where you can help you can be a lifesaving friend to all animals by telling friends and family about the important work of the hsus and asking them to become vigilant in safeguarding the lives of all animals today we are placing special emphasis on pet adoption i hope

 int rolands ranch evening int the inside of a large ranch house in mombasa kenya most of the lights are off and sunlight is streaming through the windows day camera follows closely two feet walking down a stone hallway they are moving fast the camera zooms out as the feet stop at a set of heavy wooden doors the camera now shows the back of a man opening the doors he steps inside jeffery clark shouting uncle clark flips on the lights it reveals the many stuffed trophies of roland tembo clark turns the lights off and turns to leave but is met in the doorway by ernst who is wielding a fire poker ernst nervously stand where you are sir mr tembo doesnt have visitors you are trespassing jeffery clark ernst is that you its me jeffery ernst dropping the poker oh master jeffery you scared the blazes out of me i didnt hear you knock and mister tembo didnt tell me to expect you jeffery clark im sorry ernst i let myself in where is uncle roland ernst leading clark out of the trophy room right this way sir ernst is leading clark down another shadowy hallway jeffery clark how is he ernst i didnt hear much of anything before i got on the plane ernst mister tembo is not in very good shape sir perhaps it would be best if i let the doctor apprise you of the situation ernst and clark approach a man wearing a white shirt khaki shorts and a stethoscope ernst contd master clark this is dr tambala dr tambala this is mr tembos nephew jeffery clark jeffery clark how do you do doctor dr tambala i am very well thank you i wish i could say the same about your uncle jeffery clark what happened dr tambala there was an accident on a safari mr tembo was badly injured jeffery clark what kind of accident ernst mr tembo saved some bloody americans lifeoh sorry master jeffery jeffery clark its all right ernst jeffery clark contd to tambala what happened i thought uncle roland gave up hunting after that incident in san diego dr tambala it was a sightseeing safari two of the people on the tour wandered off and were attacked by lions mr tembo went after them but the lions turned their attack on him the tour bus caught up with them a few minutes later but one of the tourists was already dead the other was hurt and roland was almost done for jeffery clark oh god dr tambala he suffered severe trauma to the neck back torso and abdomen he is lucky to be alive but hes completely paralyzed below the waist and hes lost use of his right arm jeffery clark what are his chances dr tambala its not so much a matter of chances as it is a matter of time now jeffery clark can he speak dr tambala he isnt talking very much it hurts for him to breathe jeffery clark id like to talk with him dr tambala i think that that is a good idea int rolands bedroom day clark makes his way into rolands room he sees his uncle in bed with a respirator mask over his face iv bags hang from the bedposts clark sits on the chair near rolands head jeffery clark sitting uncle roland roland tembo stirring slowly attempting to move the mask jeffery my boy so good to see you jeffery clark helping remove the mask its good to see you too uncle i hear you were being quite the hero roland tembo i told them to stay in the busthey wouldnt listen jeffery clark i know uncle i know you cant stop every idiot from acting like one roland tembo smiling faintly very true tell me what does the doctor think about my condition jeffery clark were not very optimistic im afraid roland tembo chuckling turning into coughing bloody hell i dont feel much like being optimistic either jeffery clark mom sends her best im sure she would have come with me if she knew how serious your condition is roland tembo i know she and i havent been as close as a brother and sister should have roland begins coughing hard jeffery clark easy uncle roland you need your rest clark moves to put the mask back on rolands face roland stops him roland tembo jeffery my boy im going to die jeffery clark were all going to die uncle death is what defines life remember all of those hunts you took me to i remember what you taught me roland tembo there was one hunt i never finished one hunt that caused more death than any hunt should jeffery clark the trex roland tembo yes san diego was devastated because i failed to make a clean kill jeffery clark you used what you had uncle roland theres no shame in that roland tembo it could happen again because i didnt bag the rex when i had the chance jeffery clark uncle roland tembo jeffery i am not long for this earth please i must ask you to do this for me you must finish that hunt jeffery clark you want me to take the rex roland tembo nodding with that roland motions with his to a brown case sitting on a chair just past the foot of his bed jeffery clark standing and walking toward the case is that grandpas gun roland tembo a man can only hope to leave the world a better place than when he came into it i have let loose a terrible plague upon the earth i can only rest when the scourge has been eradicated jeffery clark uncle you werent responsible for san diego john hammond and ingen were they created the rex and from what ive read in the paper they created a beast capable of killing the rex it wasnt your fault ingen started it roland tembo interrupting and we have to finish it jeffery clark uncle roland tembo jeffrey please i regret nothing from my life except that jeffery clark thinking for a moment before grabbing the case it wont be easy getting there roland tembo you have access to all of my resourcesi seem to have no need for money anymore jeffery clark promise me one thing roland tembo anything i can do i will jeffery clark dont go anywhere until i bring you the trophy clark walks toward the door he turns and nods at roland who is smiling weakly clark exits and shuts the door behind him 
 ext cemetery day ext a light rain is falling on a cemetery in california day start with a wide shot of the cemetery follow a single umbrellacarrying individual up the hill to join the funeral under an awning we cant see his face but he makes his way over to two other individuals standing apart from the main group who we only see from the back the man closes and shakes off his umbrella it is malcolm the other two people grant and sattler turn to look at him ian malcolm whispered dr grant dr sattler alan grant whispered dr malcolm ellie sattler whispered hello ian alan grant have any trouble getting in ian malcolm yeah the rain delayed the flight fr strug from the head of the congregation let us go now not in sadness but rejoicing in the knowledge that our husband our father our grandfather and our friend has been granted eternal salvation and a place where he may walk with the angels in heaven amen the congregation responds with an amen and there is a great shuffling of feet and chairs as the mourners get up to leave the bagpiper again plays amazing grace as malcom walks toward the casket ian malcolm to casket well john for the first time in a long time i dont know what to say you and i have never been on particularly good terms and i regret not burying that hatchet while you were still alive but at the same time i cant help but think that your passing adds a sense of closure to twelve years of horror ah thats not what i meant to saymaybe id better just leave it as goodbye goodbye john malcom takes a single rose from inside of his jacket and tosses on the coffin he walks back toward grant and sattler but the camera pans down to the headstone which reads jonathon parker hammond 19232004 ellie sattler to malcom saying your goodbyes ian malcolm it still doesnt seem entirely real alan grant it is strange to think of how many deaths that he was partly responsible for and its only catching up to him now ellie sattler he never really wanted anyone to die he was just so intent on making history that he forgot the human cost could be devastating samuel perkins approaching from behind dr grant dr sattler and dr malcolm alan grant yes thats us samuel perkins hi im samuel perkins executor of mr hammonds estate while we were drawing up his final will he wanted me to make sure i contacted you in person ian malcolm he left us something samuel perkins a message alan grant what is it samuel perkins he recorded it a few weeks before his death im to show it to the three of you as soon as possible perkins reaches into his coat pocket and pulls out business cards samuel perkins contd if youd like to stop by my office tomorrow and i know youre all very busy so id be more than happy to finish this up as soon as possible fade out 
 int samuel perkins office morning int grant malcolm and sattler are seated in front of a desk in a legal office bookcases line the walls a tv on a mobile stand is behind the desk with a leather chair morning ian malcolm actually the san diego incident restored a lot of my credibility i was no longer a lunatic who had seen dinosaurs with a bunch of other people who didnt alan grant about that ellie sattler were really sorry we didnt back you up about the park alan grant there was just so much at stakeresearch money had been really hard to come by in retrospect it wasnt worth lying ellie sattler you lost as much as we did on that island we shouldnt have deserted you alan grant im sorry ian ian malcolm i have to admit i did hold it against you in the beginning but now i look back and i realize that three lunatics would have been no more convincing to the general public than just one ellie sattler are you forgiving us ian malcolm smirking well i dont usually let people slide for mistakes of this magnitude but what the heck its water under the bridge perkins enters from behind grant malcolm and sattler he is carrying a large manila envelope samuel perkins moving from the door to his desk sorry to have kept you waiting for so long i know we all have business to tend to today so ill be as brief as possible perkins reads off of the envelope samuel perkins contd i jonathon parker hammond as my final wish request that the following video be shown only to alan grant ellen sattler and ian malcolm and only to the three of the aforementioned as a group of three on the occasion of my death ian malcolm just your average farewell from beyond the grave boilerplate huh samuel perkins laughing mr hammond hated lawyers almost as much as he hated the language we use samuel perkins contd indicating the vhs tape but i think this should be quite straightforward mr hammond always seemed like that kind of man to me alan grant searching for the word he was ellie sattler unique ian malcolm to put it mildly samuel perkins turning on the tv okay im just going to go ahead and start this tape when perkins turns on the tv cnn shows on the screen with one of their regular programs when he pushes play the screen goes black for a moment then john hammond fades into view he is dressed in a robe and is clearly reclining in a hospital bed with iv bags hanging near him and a heart monitor at his side john hammond gday i suppose that if youre watching this the inevitable has already occurred i have passed from this life to what i hope will be a merciful afterlife john hammond contd i want to take a moment to apologize once more to each of you for the tremendous pain and hardships i put you through dr sattler i hope you can find it in your heart to forgive me for what happened in the park i know the years that followed the disaster werent easy on you or your relationship with dr grant dr grant i want to apologize to you for burdening you with the safety of what amounted to three children on two separate islands i know that the revelation of site b has had a negative impact on your research in montana i hope you find a way to continue your excellent work in the field dr malcolm you put yourself in harms way twice at my request i had no intention of ever hurting anyone but misfortune seemed to be the norm on the islands john hammond contd id also like to thank the three of you i thank dr sattler for teaching me humility before the disaster on isla nublar i thought of myself as the creator of a perfect system a god of the island itself as it turns out i was only playing god as ian pointed out so well thank you ian for teaching me that there are some things man cannot control dr grant i want to thank you again for taking care of my grandchildren in the park what you did for them and then what you did for that family on isla sorna are truly worthy of the highest praise john hammond contd finally i must ask the three of you for something i have long considered myself the steward of the islands and their inhabitants but i will not be here forever when i am gone they will need someone to be their caretakers their advocates and their guardians i am asking the three of you to take up my cause im not asking you because i feel you owe me anything quite the opposite i am asking you to take this responsibility because you are the only three people in the world i know i can trust to make the right decisions john hammond contd before i leave you id like to let you know ive done everything in my power to provide for the welfare and well being of the families of those souls lost on the islands ive also set up a trust fund for the defense of the islands mr perkins will be able to provide you with all the necessary paperwork and ive retained him as chief counsel for you any other information you could need lies in the mind of dr garret wang he was my head engineer at site b after the facility was cleared out dr wang went to work for a firm in seattlegeneticorp john hammond contd id like to say im sorry one more time and ask you to consider what ive asked of you if not for me then for the animals themselves god bless you and good luck the tv screen fades to black and then goes to static perkins pops the tape out and cnn rolls muted in the background samuel perkins turning to face grant sattler and malcolm like mr hammond said i have all of the papers for the dinosaur defense fund right here alan grant looking over perkins shoulder at the tv screen what the hell is that all four people move closer to the tv as perkins turns the sound on cnn has a live breaking news story datelined in costa rica the video camera pans between the reporter and a large footprint in the wet beach sand melina ortega os as you can see by the size of this impression this is a very large creature witnesses estimate its length at about forty of fifty feet with gigantic toothfilled jaws frantic witness in broken english the thing was laying on the beach when i woke up this morning one of the dogs from the neighborhood ran up to it and started barking the lizard woke up and made a horrible noise the whole village shook melina ortega apparently the creatures roar brought many curious villagers out of their homes when it caught sight of them it attacked casualty reports range anywhere from a half dozen to twenty or more melina ortega contd motioning for the camera to point toward military vehicles in the background as you can see behind me the us marines have already arrived apparently they were engaging in training maneuvers near the panama canal when word of this broke while it is not clear what the strategy here will be it is clear that they are not underestimating the threat camera focuses on a tank ellie sattler my god theyre on the mainland alan grant oh no ian malcolm damn it john you knew this could happen scene cuts back to the tv screen melina ortega walking swiftly toward a group of armored vehicles were being told to clear the area so were heading into an area the marines have rendered safe we wont be able to broadcast a live feed from the area so until were clear this is melina ortega live in costa rica cnn anchor our thoughts and prayers for a safe return are with you melina right now we have just received amateur footage of the attack and were going to roll that for you now a grainy video recorded at early dawn shows a twolegged dinosaur tearing open a car and disappearing into the jungle cnn anchor contd os again this was taken by an amateur cameraman in costa rica sometime in the predawn hours of this morning the picture quality isnt good but you can clearly see what can only be described as a dinosaur attacking a car tv cuts back to the anchorman cnn anchor contd of course we havent seen anything like this since the 1997 incident in san diego when a tyrannosaurus rex created by ingen got loose and went on a rampage through the city ian malcolm is this really happening grant sattler and perkins are all glued to the tv when there is a knock at the door samuel perkins not really paying attention come a young army officer steps into the office lt amy brannigan sorry to bother you sir i was sent for dr alan grant and dr ian malcolm alan grant thats us what do you need lt amy brannigan you gentlemen need to come with me ian malcolm what why lt amy brannigan sir my orders are to bring you to the base alan grant look miss lt amy brannigan its lieutenant lieutenant brannigan alan grant of course im sorry its just that a lot has happened in such a short time and i think were all just going to need a little time to put it all together lt amy brannigan sir i know you might feel that way right now but i have been ordered to bring you with me without delay ian malcolm im afraid i have to agree with dr grant here lieutenant lt amy brannigan sir there are two military police officer waiting in the hall and two more outside im to place you under arrest if you dont come with me right now alan grant well ian it looks like wed better go alan grant contd whispering to sattler ellie go to seattle and find dr wang we need to know everything we can about whatever this thing is ellie sattler you think this has something to do with the incident in costa rica alan grant id bet my bottom dollar 
 ext isla sorna dawn ext clark is crouching in the middle of the trex nest on isla sorna he is holding his uncles hh in his hands and is wearing a ghille suit dawn clark reaches up to press a button on his left shoulder he begins recording jeffery clark to the microphone isla sorna day fourteen i have been on this island for two weeks and ive seen no sign of either the trex or the spinosaurus i have been to all of the locations that the animals were said to frequent but without avail i am out of food and set to meet the helicopter at the designated meeting point in twelve hours i regret that i am coming home from this hunt emptyhanded 
 jurassic park iv chris hartman ext samara costa rica midday ext a blackhawk helicopter lands in samara costa rica armored vehicles are holding positions around a ravaged village midday as the helicopter lands grant and malcolm debark the chopper takes off again as a humvee approaches them gen horatio sanchez exits the vehicle and walks up to them gen horatio sanchez shouting over the helicopter dr grant dr malcolm welcome to costa rica im general sanchez and im in command of this little fiasco sorry we had to drag you here so abruptly but you know what they say about desperate times alan grant why are we here gen horatio sanchez we need you help dr grant if youll follow me sanchez leads grant and malcolm down to the beach gen horatio sanchez contd frankly ive never seen anything like this id wager no one has save you two and a handful of others we didnt know what to make of it at first and how to preserve the specimen was a bit ambiguous but one of our marines was a big paleontology nut and had read all about you and your work and how to preserve delicate fossils he managed to rig something up to protect the sample from the elements until you could arrive to make the positive identification ian malcolm so why am i here gen horatio sanchez youve seen firsthand how a dinosaur behaves in an urban environment ian malcolm if youre talking about san diego i can assure you that this area is substantially different gen horatio sanchez what do you mean ian malcolm what i saw was a dinosaur in a highlydeveloped downtown area with nowhere to hide this is a small village with dense jungle on all sides it might as well be back on the island gen horatio sanchez but you did see the dinosaurs on the islands ian malcolm only the trexes gen horatio sanchez so you are uniquely familiar with the behaviors of dinosaurs interacting with people ian malcolm yes but im sure dr grant is much more of an asset than i am alan grant scared ian ian malcolm extremely i have been brought into a dinosaurinfested area to provide advice im not competent to give alan grant dinosaurinfested its only one ian malcolm one is way too many you know that gen horatio sanchez regardless of your objections dr malcolm youre here the government wouldnt have brought you into this area unless it felt you would be an asset the three of them arrive at a large tarpcovered square gen horatio sanchez contd here we are lets get this thing up a few marines lift the frame up and out offscreen revealing a large footprint gen horatio sanchez contd what do you make of that dr grant grant stoops low and examines the trackway alan grant rising i couldnt tell you for sure general but it looks a bit bigger than the trex tracks ive seen unless ingen created another gigantic predator id say its probably the spinosaur gen horatio sanchez okay ill call the pentagon sanchez shouts for a soldier to set up the communications equipment to contact the pentagon and walks away from grant and malcolm ian malcolm spinosaurus alan grant yeah we encountered it on isla sorna ian malcolm odd we didnt alan grant hammond said the animals were territorial it might be that the spinosaur had shifted its hunting area in the years between our little escapades ian malcolm i didnt read much of anything on your misadventure on site b alan grant well the kirbys decided to let me have the movie rights as compensation for shall we say services rendered i was actually working with universal in la when john died ian malcolm any reason you didnt bring me in on this alan grant god knows i tried ian youre a hard man to track down obviously the rights are as much yours as they are mine i only accepted the offer to help fund the research were doing in montana ian malcolm a movie about dinosaurs do you think the public will buy that the conversation is interrupted by a helicopter flying low toward the beach several marines shout as they hurry to cover the footprint grant and malcolm look toward sanchez who is shouting in a megaphone gen horatio sanchez through the megaphone attention pilot this is a nofly zone you are not authorized to land here return to your point of origin immediately the helicopter touches down on the sand and a man hops out of the rear door he is carrying a large duffel bag and wearing khaki trousers khaki shirt and a black ball cap the man slams the door closed pounds on it with his fist and points skyward the chopper takes off as the man is surrounded by marines and humvees ian malcolm who the hell is this alan grant beats me wheres general sanchez ian malcolm pointing toward the circle of marines and the man i think hes going over to greet the newcomer the man is now facing away from grant and malcolm he is at gunpoint and on his knees with his hands behind his head grant and malcolm jog over to the site of the commotion the man clark who has his hands cuffed behind his back is being lead over to sanchez gen horatio sanchez shouting at clark just who the hell are you and what the hell do you think youre doing jeffery clark my name is jeffery clark ive been hunting on an island off the coast and i needed to resupply gen horatio sanchez didnt your pilot hear the radio warnings this is a nofly zone no one gets in and no one gets out jeffery clark there must have been a mistake we thought this was some sort of market gen horatio sanchez you cant be serious jeffery clark does it really matter im here now and ill be on my way back to the island just as soon as i buy some food gen horatio sanchez oh no youre not you are under arrest for violating a military order jeffery clark noting sanchezs insignia look general do you really have the facilities to hold me ian malcolm excuse me general sanchez mr clark was it what island were you hunting on jeffery clark well since it looks like im already in trouble it cant hurt to tell you i was on isla sorna ian malcolm you were hunting dinosaurs jeffery clark sarcastically no isla sorna is well known for its penguin population jeffery clark contd recognizing malcolm wait are you ian malcolm ian malcolm yes do i know you jeffery clark no you knew my uncle roland tembo ian malcolm i wouldnt say i knew him that well how is he doing by the way jeffery clark not well im afraid thats the only reason im here and hes not gen horatio sanchez enough mr clark you have just stumbled into a very dangerous area as much as i hate it you are stuck here until the beast is captured jeffery clark beast what beast alan grant the spinosaur gen horatio sanchez snapping at grant dr grant jeffery clark what about the rexes alan grant what about the rexes jeffery clark they werent on the island either ian malcolm how many trexes are we talking about here as far as i knew there were only three two adults and the baby alan grant right and one of them was killed by the spinosaur while i was on the island jeffery clark so there might be two more dinosaurs on the mainland gen horatio sanchez gentlemen we cant just jump to that conclusion ian malcolm hes right there could be a thousand reasons you didnt see the trexes on the island maybe the spinosaur killed the other two in the interim since he killed the first one maybe they swam for it and drowned the fact is we dont know and we shouldnt draw conclusions that might further disturb the public cpl rick townsend running toward sanchez general sanchez sir news from nosara gen horatio sanchez what is it an attack cpl rick townsend no sir another footprint has been found gen horatio sanchez same print cpl rick townsend no sir its smaller sir jeffery clark what are the chances the spinos feet shrunk gen horatio sanchez shut up mr clark dr grant could the tracks have been made by the same animal alan grant its possible where is nosra gen horatio sanchez corporal cpl rick townsend nosara sir its about fifteen or twenty kilometers up the coast alan grant i imagine its technically possible a trex moving at full speed was clocked at thirtysome miles per hour the spinosaur had a slightly longer gait so id put its normal walking speed at about ten maybe fifteen miles per hour gen horatio sanchez right and that would put him there within an hour of leaving here and it was last seen almost six hours ago it had plenty of time to get up there cpl rick townsend sir we have reason to believe the tracks were made less than an hour ago given the prints position and the receeding tide it couldnt have been made more than fortyfive minutes ago gen horatio sanchez jesus fortyfive minutes ago cpl rick townsend well fifty minutes now sir alan grant and whats the size difference cpl rick townsend twelve inches sir alan grant general sanchez i think we have to consider the possibility that there is a second dinosaur in costa rica gen horatio sanchez thinking then sighing corporal get on the horn notify all units of the second dinosaur cpl rick townsend yes sir townsend leaves gen horatio sanchez you three stay here im going to call washington and break the news to them jeffery clark motioning to his hands general would you mind sanchez motions for a marine to unlock clarks hands jeffery clark contd what about my bag gen horatio sanchez its still being searched youll get it back when were satisfied that youre no longer a threat in the mean time stay put sanchez walks off toward a communications tent grants phone rings its sattler calling from seattle the shot cuts between each speaker as they talk alan grant alan grant ellie sattler alan its ellie alan grant oh ellie how are you doing what have you found out ellie sattler i found dr wang he was less than willing to be helpful but i managed to glean a few things alan grant about the spinosaur what about the spinosaur ellie sattler as it turns out the spino was one of the first dinosaurs bred on the island apparantly there was a mixup in the lab and they cloned a spinosaur instead of a tyrannosaur alan grant great how does that help us ellie sattler it gets worse actually the spino and the rexes were both prototypes for the lysine contingency but the system wasnt perfected until the next set of dinosaurs were cloned alan grant ellie what are you saying ellie sattler alan the spino and the rexes dont need supplemental enzymes to survive they can make their own lysine alan grant then how can we stop them ellie sattler i dont know but please be careful alan grant thanks ellie i will grant walks back toward sanchez malcolm and clark ian malcolm dr sattler alan grant yes ian malcolm what did she find out gen horatio sanchez walking back from the tent whos dr sattler alan grant she located the head researcher at of site b he told her that the spinosaur and the trexes were not bred lysinedeficient gen horatio sanchez and that means what to us exacty alan grant it means the animals can exist indefinitly eating nonlysineenriched food ian malcolm you mean whatever they can find alan grant im afraid so jeffery clark general i came down here to hunt the trex and i will do so if you let me gen horatio sanchez mr clark i cant in good conscience let a civillian go on his own when there are not one but two dangerous creatures still running amok even if there werent dinosaurs in this are i wouldnt let you leave with enough firepower to engage a small armored division jeffery clark are you talking about my uncles elephant gun or my rifle gen horatio sanchez jesus clark its a fifty caliber antimaterial rifle not your everyday deer gun jeffery clark im hunting something a little bigger than a deer i can tell you that alan grant wait a minute we still dont know why the spinosaur came here but if the relationship between the two species is the same we can assume why the trex came too ian malcolm you think the rex is chasing the spinosaur alan grant i read sarah hardings book about the parenting instincts of the trexes if they destroyed your trailers because you took their infant imagine what theyd have done if you had killed it ian malcolm so the spinosaur kills the baby rex and mom goes out looking for revenge how would it have even tracked it alan grant by smell the trex was only a few hours behind the spinosaur they could very easily have left at nearly the same time gen horatio sanchez the question still remains how do we find them i think its pretty clear that we seal off costa ricas borders if either one of them gets south of panama well never find them in the amazon ian malcolm considering general that these animals swam twohundred miles to get here i think its safe to say they could swim from here to south america without much difficulty alan grant we need to find one of them if we find the trex it will lead us to the spinosaur if we find the spinosaur the trex will come to us first well have to figure out a more secure method for containing them clearly an ocean is no obstacle gen horatio sanchez dr grant the official position is to neutralize the threat as quickly as possible alan grant what are you talking aboutneutralize ian malcolm alan these dinosaurs cant be contained theyve overcome every security obstacle people have put in their way if we build a better cage they are just going to break out again and again alan grant you know my dislike of john hammond was just as strong as yours but he was right ian we are the only people who can protect the animals and the island their creation may have been illegitimatized in a lab but their lives are real ian malcolm how many disasters will it take alan how many people have to end up as dinner for these dinosaurs before they become nuisances when the good of the world is on the line we have to sacrifice the good of our charges alan grant how do we do that punish them for evolving if people didnt have a right to play god by creating them we certainly dont have a right to play god by causing another extinction gen horatio sanchez gentlemen if you please we dont have time for a philosophical debate here if we can contain the animals well give it a try but my orders are to stabilize the area using any and all means necessary alan grant fine ian malcolm dr grant was right about how to find them if we can follow the rex hell lead us right to the spinosaurus but it will be hard to remain inconspicuous if we follow him with an army i suggest that we send one person to track him gen horatio sanchez any suggestions as to who the one person might be ian malcolm indicating clark the person who has been out to get the rex from day one jeffery clark me gen horatio sanchez him ian malcolm if hes half the hunter his uncle is then he should have no problem do you feel up to it jeffery clark of course i am provided i get my things back gen horatio sanchez well see about that jeffery clark also provided that i am the one who takes the tyrannosaur cpl rick townsend running from offscreen general sanchez gen horatio sanchez what is it townsend cpl rick townsend

 senate ethics panel admonishes new jersey senator for conduct related to gifts washington the senate ethics committee on tuesday night severely admonished sen robert g torricelli dnj saying he had violated senate rules by accepting and failing to disclose expensive gifts from a former contributor to whom he repeatedly gave help on the basis of thousands of pages of information developed in an earlier federal inquiry into torricellis activities the committee chastised him for using poor judgment and disregarding senate rules in his dealings with the former donor david chang your actions and failure to act led to violations of senate rules and related statutes and created at least the appearance of impropriety the three democrats and three republicans on the committee said in a threepage letter to torricelli the ethics panel also ordered torricelli to pay back chang with interest for the full value of a largescreen television set and compactdisc player and for expensive earrings that chang gave to torricellis sister to one of his close aides and to one of torricellis former girlfriends the committees action comes six months after federal prosecutors ended a lengthy criminal investigation into torricellis activities without filing criminal charges the ethics panel to which evidence from the criminal case was forwarded concluded its review just as torricelli is gearing up his campaign for reelection against the republican candidate douglas r forrester after months in which polls showed torricelli well ahead of his relatively unknown republican rival the contest has narrowed in recent weeks it was the first time that the senate ethics committee had voted to take action against a senator since 1995 when it recommended that bob packwood an oregon republican be expelled on the ground of sexual and official misconduct packwood later resigned sen daniel k inouye dhawaii who led the ethics inquiry said he believed the investigation was thorough and fair but would not offer a detailed description of the committees secret deliberations the document speaks for itself said inouye who said that he considered the matter closed with the letter within minutes after the committee released its letter publicly torricelli took the senate floor tuesday night to apologize to the people of new jersey for allowing his seat in the chamber to be placed in this position during nearly seven hours of sworn testimony last week before the members and staff of the ethics panel torricelli said that he had not taken any gifts from chang and that what items he had accepted from the businessman he had later paid chang for one person familiar with his account said torricelli also insisted that he had not done any unusual favors for chang who first turned to the senator in 1995 for help in winning the repayment of some 71 million he said he was then owed in a failed business deal with the north korean government the ethics committee was unconvinced in its letter which was signed by all six members the panel wrote that it was troubled by incongruities inconsistencies and conflicts particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to chang the committee criticized torricelli for maintaining a personal and official relationship with chang under circumstances where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself in part through a pattern of attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over a period of several years during that time the panel said torricelli and members of his senate staff took a series of actions to help chang contacting us government officials writing letters to foreign government officials and bringing chang or his business representatives into meetings with foreign officials the committee did not confirm some of the most serious allegations including changs claim that he gave torricelli tens of thousands of dollars in cash the committee said it had weighed the fact that torricellis principal accuser in the case had been chang a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the department of justice a united states district judge and his own conduct in may that judge sentenced sentenced chang to 18 months imprisonment for obstructing justice and making 53700 in illegal campaign contributions to torricellis 1996 senate campaign but at the time of changs sentencing the judge alfred m wolin also said the businessman had cooperated closely with federal investigators providing them with information that was material and credible the ethics committee has the power to punish lawmakers with sanctions ranging from public or private letters of admonition to censure or expulsion in torricellis case it acted without conducting a full investigation saying the case had been exhaustively scrutinized by federal authorities a lawyer for chang bradley d simon said tuesday night that he was disappointed that the ethics panel had confirmed only a handful of the gifts he said his client had given torricelli and that the panel did not deal with what he said were actions by torricelli to thwart the federal investigation this matter was far more serious than what the committee found simon said according to two government officials involved in the inquiry the ethics committee received a vast amount of information from federal investigators some of it under a court order issued in march that information included witness statements store receipts and other documents indicating that chang had paid for expensive items given to torricelli his sister one of his longtime aides roberta stern and one of torricellis former girlfriends judy d balaban the committees letter did not mention changs reported gifts to torricelli of an 8100 rolex watch about a dozen italianmade suits and a 3816 antique grandfather clock nor did it cite a 1590 oriental carpet that chang gave to torricellis former wife susan holloway torricelli a government official involved in the inquiry said that evidence of those gifts was either incomplete or the subject of conflicting accounts by different witnesses the committee confirmed torricellis claims he had made partial repayments to chang for two gifts a largescreen television and a stereo compactdisc player but it said the senator had showed poor judgment by failing to reimburse him for the full market value of the gifts a person familiar with torricellis testimony to the committee said he had told its members that he repaid the wholesale cost of the appliances because chang told him that was what he had paid the ethics panel also criticized torricelli for taking two bronze statues on loan from chang the statues the existence of which had not been publicly known before were displayed in torricellis senate office finally the committee appeared to have discounted torricellis contention that he was not responsible for expensive earrings that chang had given as christmas gifts to his sister stern and balaban the senators belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances displayed poor judgment and violated senate gift rules the panel found according to a government official involved in the inquiry the information reviewed by the ethics committee also included an analysis by federal investigators showing that during the period in which chang claimed to have made numerous cash payments to torricelli the senator spent thousands of dollars more in cash than investigators could account for from his bank withdrawals and other known sources of income the analysis which was assembled from banking and credit records incometax returns and congressional financialdisclosure forms showed by march of 1998 torricellis cash expenditures were more than 22000 in excess of the cash he had generated from checks and automaticteller machines an official who has reviewed the document said a spokeswoman for torricelli debra deshong said he had fully accounted for all the money he had spent senator torricelli provided the committee with a full explanation of sources of income and any funds used for cash purposes she said even after the ethics committee admonished torricelli on tuesday night one of his most important political supporters senate majority leader tom daschle dsd continued to defend him stating that the panel had found chang a witness wholly without credibility moving quickly to make a campaign issue of the senate letter bill pascoe forresters campaign manager said the findings were evidence that torricelli had undertaken an extensive campaign of misinformation and deceit and called on him to release the sworn testimony he gave to the panel pascoe said only then will new jersey

worlds most populous muslim nation and a sometimes reluctant partner in the efforts to crack down on militant islamic groups the united states cut virtually all military links with indonesia in 1999 after its forces were implicated in the violence that swept east timor after that territory voted for independence on thursday powell and representatives of the nations of the asian group including indonesia are expected to sign a declaration promising cooperation to prevent terrorism by sharing information blocking funds tightening borders and making it hard to use forged travel papers we recognized that terrorism is a global threat and that the disturbing acts of terrorism and transnational crimes which continue to threaten world peace and stability must be tackled by the international community the ministers said in a communique on tuesday powell is among the representatives from 13 nations outside southeast asia including china japan and russia that are taking part in the annual meeting of the groups regional forum terrorism dominates the agenda though the possibility of a meeting here between powell and his north korean counterpart paek nam sun has generated the most news it would be the highestlevel contact between the united states and north korea since president bush took office powell heads to indonesias capital jakarta late on thursday before finishing a weeklong trip through the region in the philippines on saturday he said that when he arrives in jakarta he will have some ideas and some initiatives to present to president megawati sukarnoputri indonesia is already receiving 400000 in the current fiscal year for civilian training programs and is to receive a like amount next year and the united states expects to provide an additional 16 million this year to train police officers in counterterrorism at the same time the pentagon is reviewing how to allocate another 17 million in counterterrorism fellowships some of which could go to indonesia but a senior state department official also acknowledged that some in the administration and congress are pushing for more direct military cooperation which would require congressional approval i think they recognize the danger that we all face and i think they have been cooperating more fully with us as time goes by and im quite sure that mrs megawati is committed to this cause powell said in singapore he met there with prime minister goh chok tong who endorsed the idea of renewed military ties between the united states and indonesia as an important step in stabilizing that country powell contended that it was not inconsistent to want to foster cooperation even with an organization like the indonesian military which has a history of human rights abuses if you get young officers expose them to a military organization that is within a democratic political institution such as the united states then that rubs off on them he said in malaysia powell met with prime minister mahathir mohamad who has led the country since 1981 the malaysian foreign minister syed hamid albar later told local reporters that powell had proposed that american and malaysian officials review the idea of forming a regional training center in malaysia to coordinate antiterrorism activities his brief stop in malaysia also highlighted the moral ambiguities of the effort to prevent terrorism and its emphasis on cooperation with governments that the united states has often criticized the united states once distanced itself from mahathir for strongarm tactics with political rivals and human rights groups criticize him for arresting and jailing scores of suspected militants including some who may be linked to alqaida without trial powell said his discussions with mahathir touched on the case of his former deputy anwar ibrahim who is serving a 15year sentence on charges of sodomy and abuse of power after trials that powell said the united states had always felt were flawed the assistant secretary of state for east asian and pacific affairs james kelly met on tuesday morning with anwars wife wan azizah wan ismail for what she later told malaysian reporters was a discussion about both the detention of her husband and six supporters and the campaign against terrorism microsoft teams with att to offer software for wireless devices and services microsoft plans to announce on wednesday a partnership with att wireless services to offer software for wireless devices and services a person close to the talks said tuesday night the deal would be part of microsofts drive to sign up wireless carriers to use its socalled smart phone software a pareddown version of the windows operating system and services that microsoft is developing as part of

carriers to use its cell phone operating system have struggled it has run into particular opposition from companies aligned with nokia which has developed a competing software but microsofts potential

pitchers less than three weeks after outfielder cliff floyd was imported to montreal to play a pivotal part in the expos playoff plans he was traded to boston tuesday night to try his hand in what the red sox hope will be their postseason plans floyd did not produce the kind of offense the expos expected from him so omar minaya the expos aggressive rookie general manager turned around and sent him to the red sox in exchange two south korean pitchers and a player yet to be named the teams made the deal less than 24 hours before tuesdays 4 pm deadline for making trades without first getting waivers on players minaya obtained floyd from the florida marlins on july 11 only two weeks after he stunned baseball by acquiring bartolo colon from cleveland colon has won four of five decisions for the expos but floyd batted only 208 for them while hitting three home runs including one tuesday night and driving in four runs with the marlins floyd bated 287 hit 18 home runs and drove in 57 runs the expos who had a 4641 record when they made their first floyd deal had only a 712 record with him on the team dropping from 9 12 games behind atlanta in the national league east to as many as 16 games back floyd can be a free agent after this season and minaya decided it would be more prudent to trade him and get value in return than have to settle for a draft choice or two as compensation when he signed with another team as a free agent the expos acquired sun wookim and seung junsong kim 24 is a righthanded pitcher from seoul the red sox signed him in 1997 song is a 22yearold righthander from pusan the red sox signed him in 1999 the red sox wanted to bolster their offense they led the yankees for most of the first three months of the season but then slipped behind them in the american league east earlier in the day tuesday one member of the red sox organization was not sure they would be able to get floyd i dont know that hes that serious about moving him the person said of minaya but as the day wore on the red sox tried harder and by tuesday night were able to get the player they wanted for their lineup exhog offers jumpstart and helps change lives washington with the barrage of crack cocaineconnected killings in the 1980s came the realization that young people were too often fullfledged players in the violence that was more evident here than in any other city said george starke who after his career as an offensive tackle with the washington redskins from 1973 to 1984 stuck around and decided to make this place more than his home there was death in dc throughout the 80s and into the 90s and there was death everywhere said starke who was reared in new rochelle ny and played at columbia it wasnt like new yorks or bostons organized crime it was kids shooting kids it was a 14yearold from r street who got his crew of six together and ran their drug block killing another 14yearold and his crew from a block away and from the beginning i could see that it was all about jobs i could see that you needed the private sector involved starke could see that in many instances these were cases of lost dignity i had a young man come up to me three years ago and say mr starke im tired of going to bed at night with a tech9 gun under my pillow and starke was tired of seeing washington and its young people suffer a black eye so after six years of planning he opened the excel institute automotive program a twoyear school that gives people a chance at a new life as an auto technician or in another job related to the field the school now in its third year has been so successful that it recently received a 2 million grant from congress the program is being copied by other cities and has attracted students from all walks of life ages 16 to 68 the program is coordinated with the university of the district of columbia students learn automotive intricacies and can earn a a high school equivalency diploma thanks to starkes vision leadership and fundraising they can do it all free starke 54 played in two super bowls and won one he played for george allen jack pardee and joe gibbs in 1973 he was young enough to be a part of the redskins over the hill gang and in 1981 he was old enough to be one of the teams original hogs he was recently named one of the 70 greatest redskins he earned a physics degree from columbia became a redskin studied drama worked in sports broadcasting opened a washington restaurant and built his own home here when he thought he might become a developer just so i could know how the business worked from the ground up he said in 1988 he bought a ford dealership in 1992 he sold it to begin work on the excel institute putting up 300000 to get things started i saw a lot of kids and young men out there with no dads and no structure who couldnt read and some of them were beginning to realize that there is no growing old as a crack dealer you either die or go to jail he said my experience in the automotive industry was there was a dire shortage of auto technicians not only in america but internationally so starke matched a problem with a problem and found a solution the institute has a fulltime staff of 18 twelve of those are teachers seventy students are participating in summer classes forty new students are expected for fall classes and there is a waiting list of at least that many starke said angela nafis 47 of ecuador has been in the school for a year she learned to speak english got a drivers license and earned her ged charles easterling 24 said he had been enrolled for a month but lived wherever im homeless now trying to find a place to lay my head he said starke said the school was helping easterling find housing easterling said he would do whatever it took to become stable john orellana 22 just got a technicians job at a jiffy lube last week not bad for a guy who was kicked out of high school in 1997 for threatening a teacher i did a lot of walking got an interview and got a job and an opportunity of a lifetime orellana said it shows if you have the will and the dedication here you can learn a lot and be something it taught me maturity this school is like a big family edward jewell 56 retired from his job as a copyright assistant at the library of congress in 1993 ive been flapping my wings since until i found this school he said i needed a new skill this has been invaluable enriching i get up and come down here at 6 am every day full of joy and energized im grateful to george starke to have had the vision to set something like this up not just for me but for all the students george is doing what hes supposed to be doing because god is blessing him and hes sure blessing me and when i become a technician i will help the poor and needy by giving them affordable rates starke said the school would move to a building near the citys bus depot in the fall the city has talked with starke about using his students for some vehicle repairs he is proud of the red cobra 427 that sits in the schools workshop it was rebuilt from shell to finish by his first class and was included in the districts millennium celebrations his current class is rebuilding a black one this one will be auctioned for the school i just wanted to be a part said starke who is certain he is the lone redskin past or present who lives in the city he has lived here for 20 years a lot of kids are afraid of the process and i wanted to take the process out for this school once they are in all they have to do is come every day come on time every day and work hard a little more than 50 percent of our kids make it through i want it to be more but my job is not to see that everybody makes it my job is to see that everybody has the opportunity to make it rare coin fetches record 759 million at auction new york the 1933 double eagle a 20 gold piece with a mysterious history that involves a president a king and a secret service sting operation was auctioned tuesday last night for a record price for a coin 759 million nearly double the previous record the anonymous buyer believed to be an individual collector who lives in the united states made the winning bid in a fiercely contested nineminute auction at sothebys in manhattan eight bidders were joined by 500 coin collectors and dealers in an auction house audience seemingly devoid of celebrity bidders while an additional 534 observers followed the bidding on ebay as auction houses prepare for their fall seasons in an uncertain economy the sale price suggests that the marketplace for important items is enormously strong said david redden a vice chairman at sothebys who was the auctioneer this is an astonishing new record for a coin he said in an unprecedented move the auction proceeds were split by the us mint and a london coin dealer stephen fenton who had won that right in court after having been arrested by secret service agents for trying to sell the coin in the waldorfastoria hotel in manhattan in 1996 henrietta holsman fore the director of the us mint who witnessed the sale said the monies we receive will go toward helping to pay down the debt and to fight the war on terrorism fenton commented that the double eagle had been on a long historic journey with a very satisfying ending he added i am thrilled with the price the previous numismatic record holder was an 1804 us silver dollar which sold for 414 million in 1999 sothebys partner in the onelot auction was stacks rare coins with which it shared the customary 15 percent commission i have never seen as much interest in the sale of any coin in my 30 years in the business said lawrence r stack the companys managing director this is the mona lisa of coins said beth deisher editor of coin world the largest weekly coin publication in the united states with a circulation of 85000 it is unique forbidden fruit collectors web sites have surged with speculation about the sale price and enthusiasts even organized betting pools on tuesday night redden took the podium for nine minutes before the gavel came down recognizing bidders in the audience and on the telephone the tension in the crowd was broken with a burst of applause after the 5 million mark and a louder explosion at 6 million the rumor in the crowd had been that anything under 6 million would be a bargain said ute wartenberg executive director of the american numismatic society in manhattan most bidders dropped out after that price the gavel sounded at 66 million after a sothebys senior vice president selby kiffer made the final bid for the anonymous buyer on the telephone the sale price of 66 million when added to the commission totaled 759 million the auction attendance was swelled by coin collectors who had gathered on the eve of the american numismatic association convention the largest coin show of the year expected to draw more than 10000 people to the marriott marquis hotel wednesday so the auction was almost like the ribboncutting ceremony for the convention stack said fore of the mint said the high price for the coin was reached because it is one of a kind it is beautiful and it has a great story the coin was the only 1933 double eagle that has ever been legally offered for sale and its maltese falconesque history only recently came to light thanks to documents unearthed during the fiveyear legal battle over its ownership in 1792 it was deemed that all gold and silver us coins would bear the depiction of an eagle but gold pieces were issued only after a gold rush boom in 1850 they were called double eagles because their face value was twice that of the original 10 gold piece following the suggestion of president theodore roosevelt the sculptor augustus saintgaudens redesigned the coin in 1907 in high relief forever after giving the coins the designation saints but in 1933 president franklin d roosevelt took the united states off the gold standard and ordered all the 1933 saints already manufactured destroyed save for two reserved for the smithsonian institution they were never declared legal currency presumably after being stolen by a mint employee nine double eagles surfaced during the mid1940s and 1950s they were seized by the secret service and melted down but before these coins came to light the royal legation of egypt turned up with one at the department of the treasury and somehow got an official to issue an export license for the coin to enhance the collection of king farouk by the time that blunder was discovered the coin had left the united states in 1954 after the king was deposed his coins were sold at auction and the double eagle vanished it went underground until it came to fenton in 1995 his arrest in manhattan after attempting to sell the coin for 15 million led to a court battle over whether thanks to the treasurys mistaken export permission in 1944 the coin could be legally owned the double eagle came close to being melted down many times the coin once again escaped destruction when it was moved from the treasury department vault in 7 world trade center eight months before the building collapsed after the sept 11 terrorist attack the record price was seen as a gift by coin collectors many people believe that our great coin rarities are vastly undervalued in comparison to old master paintings deisher said in a ceremony after the sale fore of the mint declared the coin the only 1933 double eagle ever to be legally issued by the us government this monetized the coin making it legal tender the buyer will receive a certificate of transfer stating just that but only after paying the auction price and a fee of 20 for the face value of the coin ethics committee cites torricellis poor judgment following are excerpts from the findings of the senate ethics committees report on sen robert g torricellis dealings with david chang 1 your acceptance of a television and stereo cd player upon payment from david chang of an amount you understood to be the cost to mr chang rather than fair market retail value evidenced poor judgment displayed a lack of due regard for senate rules and resulted in a violation of the senate gifts rules 35 and consequently a violation of your public disclosure obligations under senate rules 2 your acceptance on loan from mr chang of bronze statues eagle and bronco buster for display in your senate office under your offices policy of accepting the loan of home state artwork was not consistent with senate rules governing such loans evidenced poor judgment displayed a lack of due regard for the senate rules and resulted in a violation of the senate gifts rule 35 and consequently a violation of your public disclosure obligations under senate rules 3 your failure to act to prevent the acceptance of or to pay for gifts of earrings from mr chang to individuals your sister an employee and a friend in your home at christmas on the mistaken belief that such items were of little value or were not gifts to you under the circumstances evidenced poor judgment displayed a lack of due regard for senate rules and resulted in a violation of the senate gifts rule 35 and consequently a violation of your public disclosure obligations under senate rule 34 4 continuation of a personal and official relationship with mr chang under circumstances where you knew that he was attempting to ingratiate himself in part through a pattern of attempts to provide you and those around you with gifts over a period of several years when you and your senate office were taking official actions of benefit to mr chang contacting united states government officials writing letters to foreign government officials and involving mr chang of his representatives in situations where you were meeting with officials of foreign governments evidenced poor judgment 5 the committee has also considered that the principal source of the allegations against you is david chang a witness whose credibility has been called into question by the department of justice a united states district judge and his own conduct in court documents the government noted that chang could not be trusted on may 23 2002 mr chang was convicted of attempting to corruptly persuade a witness to give false testimony a conspiracy to violate the federal election law and four violations of the federal election law 6 after evaluating the extensive body of evidence before it and your testimony the committee is troubled by incongruities inconsistencies and conflicts particularly concerning actions taken by you which were or could have been of potential benefit to mr chang therefore the committee expresses its determination that your actions and failure to act led to violations of senate rules and related statutes and created at least the appearance of impropriety and you are hereby severely admonished further the committee notes section 1c1 of the senate gift rule 35 concerning anything which is paid for at market value or returned as well as your commitment to pay for any item which the committee might conclude were in violation of the rules and has further concluded that you must pay chang an amount sufficient to bring the total to fair market retail value of the tv and cd player as well as the fair market retail value of the earrings given to the three individuals at your home with appropriate interest the committee understands that you have previously delivered the bronze statues to the department of justice from whence they should be returned to chang mccall ad long on introduction by shaila k dewan new york this 30second commercial is the first in h carl mccalls campaign for the democratic nomination for governor and will be broadcast upstate in major broadcast markets and on cable in new york city starting today on the screen the words his resume is an american dream a quotation from time magazine appear on the screen a series of snapshots and images are then a visual resume for mccall they show him as an army lieutenant at his swearingin as a state senator as ambassador to the united nations surrounded by children as new york city school board president and at other jobs leading up to his current position state comptroller a photograph of the candidate standing in his army uniform next to his mother is shown then the advertisement shifts to mccall talking about education while images of the candidate looking at a computer screen with a small child and of him surrounded by children appear the action then shifts to him in an office speaking to the camera as the words experience excellence carl mccall appear on the screen the script a male voice says time magazine called his life an american dream carl mccall army lieutenant state senator ambassador to the united nations school board president citibank vice president and one of the most effective comptrollers in new york history the candidate says i grew up poor with a single mother she said educations a sledgehammer it can open doors to opportunity thats what education did for me as governor ill make sure that every kid in new york has the same opportunity i had to get a good education accuracy this advertisement is long on introductions and short on claims of merit thus most of the facts presented are a matter of record he had the title of ambassador when he was at the united nations but he was not the chief of the american mission and time magazine actually called his resume not his life an american dream but it also followed that up with a reference to his life saying he was one of six children and raised on welfare as for the claim about his success as comptroller where he controls the state pension funds there is no disputing the funds growth during his terms but some critics say it had more to do with the buoyancy of the stock market in the 1990s than skilled management scorecard the advertisement attempts to make several points and reach several different constituencies for one it counters the high name recognition of andrew m cuomo mccalls opponent by offering voters a straightforward introduction to the candidate emphasizing his long list of highlevel jobs in both the public and private sector it also emphasizes leadership an important campaign issue after sept 11 at the same time it gives mccall a chance to intertwine his bootstraps story with the broader issue of children and education a priority of many democratic voters new jersey supreme court overturns transsexuals death sentence by laura mansnerus trenton nj the new jersey supreme court on tuesday overturned the death sentence of leslie ann nelson a transsexual gogo dancer who killed a police officer and an investigator with an ak47 rifle the court vacating nelsons death sentence for the second time ruled on two grounds that the jury could have been confused by instructions on the verdict sheet and that the prosecutor made improper accusations in his closing argument nelson 44 had been the only woman of 14 people on new jerseys death row the ruling which does not affect nelsons guilty plea sends the case back to the trial court for resentencing the state attorney generals office has not decided whether to seek the death penalty again a spokesman peter aseltine said tuesday the court upheld the sentence of another death row inmate robert o marshall convicted of arranging the murder of his wife at a picnic area on the garden state parkway in its 5to0 decision in the nelson case the court showed continuing uneasiness with the death penalty as it has done even since adopting a voluminous set of review procedures in 1999 to govern capital cases new jersey has not had an execution since 1963 justice james r zazzali and justice virginia long said in a separate opinion that in addition to the reasons given in the majority opinion also written by zazzali they believed the death penalty would constitute cruel and unusual punishment because of nelsons history of emotional disturbance zazzali and long had expressed similar reservations in june 2001 when the court overturned the death sentence of thomas j koskovich who was 18 when he killed two pizza deliverymen in an ambush the majority opinion tuesday said the court would impose higher standards in capital cases when reviewing prosecutors conduct and possibly ambiguous jury instructions while all five members of the majority found the instructions to the jury on weighing aggravating and mitigating factors to be confusing two of those justices wrote in a partial dissent that the prosecutors statements in his summation about the defenses expert witnesses were within the bounds of acceptable argument two of the courts members chief justice deborah t poritz and justice peter g verniero did not participate in the nelson case because both are former attorneys general nelson born glenn nelson had severe psychological problems and a history of reclusive behavior into adulthood and was convicted on a weapons charge in 1988 after undergoing sex change surgery in 1992 she pursued a career as an exotic dancer in april 1995 while she was living with her parents in haddon heights outside philadelphia law enforcement officers arrived at the house with a warrant for nelsons arrest on another weapons charge during a 14hour standoff she killed a patrolman and an investigator from the camden county prosecutors office she pleaded guilty to murder and was sentenced to death by a jury in 1997 the supreme court overturned that sentence in july 1998 ruling that the prosecution had failed to disclose important information to the jury a second jury sentenced nelson to death in march 2001 in marshalls case the 51 decision upheld a lower courts dismissal of his petition for further review of his 1986 murder conviction marshall an insurance agent from toms river was convicted of hiring a man to kill his wife while the couple were going home after an evening of dining and gambling in atlantic city the case was the subject of joe mcginniss bestselling book blind faith editorial the shame of egypt the new york times said in an editorial for wednesday july 31 president hosni mubarak of egypt describes himself as americas leading arab ally yet his antidemocratic behavior is an embarrassment to washington and an affront to his own people the latest example is mondays resentencing of saad eddin ibrahim a sociologist and human rights activist to seven years in prison for his efforts to register voters monitor elections and report attacks on egypts coptic christians ibrahim who holds dual united states and egyptian citizenship is 63 years old and ailing the verdict should be annulled not just on humanitarian grounds but because his prosecution is an abrogation of the most basic standards of justice ibrahims harsh punishment sends a chilling message to egyptians yearning for a more accountable and tolerant society egyptian courts are neither fair nor independent like every other government institution they hew closely to mubaraks wishes that is especially true of the state security court that ruled in this case ibrahim might never have been tried had he not written an article taking note of mubaraks efforts to create a presidential dynasty nor is it likely his sentence would have been reaffirmed if mubarak believed that convicting an american citizen for promoting democracy and human rights might jeopardize his own standing with the bush administration and the 2 billion annual american subsidy that keeps his government afloat that aid bonanza was granted to reward mubaraks predecessor anwar sadat for signing a peace treaty with israel washington has never demanded good governance and democracy from cairo in return in recent months president bush has spoken of the need to promote democracy in the arab world but so far he has pushed the point only with the palestinians it is time to extend this policy to egypt while hardly the worst example of dictatorship in the middle east egypt is one of the saddest it is a country with a long and glorious history a substantial middle class a peace treaty with israel and large quantities of american aid under mubarak it has squandered economic and diplomatic opportunities and relentlessly stifled political debate its official media are awash in antiamerican and antisemitic propaganda the state department and american officials in cairo have issued diplomatically phrased protests of ibrahims trial and sentence this is entirely insufficient what is needed is a message delivered personally by bush and other top officials not only about the inexcusable treatment of ibrahim but of the contemptuous approach to democratic values editorial governor pataki weighs in the new york times said in an editorial for wednesday july 31 responding to a wave of public dismay over the first designs for rebuilding lower manhattan gov george pataki has sent word that its time to go back to the drawing board it is the right message sent while it is still early enough to do something constructive about the disappointing quality of the work so far the governor like mayor michael bloomberg now seems committed to creating a better mix of uses for ground zero and a 24hour community in manhattans downtown while rethinking the plans will delay the original rebuilding schedule slightly it does not need to stall progress if the governor keeps the pressure on the lower manhattan development corp and the port authority of new york and new jersey new york cannot afford to have a gaping hole that mocks the city and its process for rebuilding what was destroyed pataki openly questioned the port authoritys requirement that any plan for the site replace all the office hotel and retail square footage lost in the attack on sept 11 more than anything else that specification limited the designs to the undistinguished options presented two weeks ago renegotiating that issue with the world trade center leaseholders should begin immediately opening the process to other designers both here and internationally will help separate this urban plan from the ordinary the city also needs to begin openly discussing what happens underground in particular with the transportation network at this point planners have focused on shortterm repair of path and subway lines with mediumrange proposals being shopped in washington that could untangle the disorganized web of subway lines downtown within the next few weeks the lower manhattan development corp and the port authority should offer some bigger ideas about how to connect the downtown area better to the rest of the region lowering west street alongside the world trade center site and building a park or esplanade on top is another option that has been popular with those reviewing the first six public proposals but it would be expensive and the governor the mayor and their friends in washington will have to look at longrange ways to pay the bill patakis recent remarks are a sign that he understands how central the rebuilding of lower manhattan will be to his own political legacy now he needs to follow through with action to keep demonstrating that his core concern is coming up with the best possible plan not simply keeping the issue on hold until after this falls election editorial a pallid clean air plan the new york times said in an editorial for wednesday july 31 president bush has now unveiled his longawaited clear skies proposal which he promises will simplify and strengthen the clean air act without crippling american industry a debate on how to make the 32yearold clean air act a stronger and more efficient instrument is surely long overdue but the bush plan falls well short of the only other credible proposal on the table a bill sponsored by sen james jeffords independent of vermont like jeffords the president calls for substantial reductions in three major pollutants the nitrogen oxides that produce smog sulfur dioxide which causes acid rain and mercury but he ignores emissions of carbon dioxide the main global warming gas that is a huge omission even for the pollutants he addresses bushs timetable is too leisurely he aims to reduce all three by 70 percent by 2018 the jeffords proposal would make the same sizable reductions by 2008 finally the bush proposal would roll back key provisions of the existing clean air act that jeffords would keep bush argues that the regulatory mechanisms he has in mind for reaching clear skies goals chiefly a marketbased emissions trading scheme will be so effective that the need for many existing rules will disappear this page has long embraced emissions trading as an essential tool for reducing pollution at manageable cost we also agree that the law needs streamlining but some regulations aimed at specific regional problems that nationwide trading alone is unable to address cannot lightly be abandoned among these are rules governing emissions that limit visibility in the national parks and rules governing pollution that drifts eastward from midwestern power plants indeed bush has already made clear his intention to roll back one of the most important of these regulations a provision known as new source review that compels utilities to install modern pollution controls whenever they significantly upgrade older plants the 1970 clean air act is a landmark statute deserving of thoughtful improvement the bush bill as written is not the way to get there

rewriting throughout by richard sandomir c2002 new york times news service a russian accused of being in organized crime was arrested in italy on wednesday on an american complaint that he conspired to fix the pairs figure skating and ice dancing competitions at the recent salt lake winter olympics which were dominated by the sports judging scandals the russian alimzhan tokhtakhounov who was arrested by the italian authorities at his resort home in forte dei marmi appeared to have a singular motivation for rigging the competitions getting a visa to return to france where he once lived the federal prosecutor in manhattan alleged in a criminal complaint that tokhtakhounov had conceived and directed a scheme with a second man alleged to be in the russian mob and a member of the russian skating federation to secure a gold medal for the top russian pairs skaters and for the top french ice dancers one of whom is a russian the russian team of yelena berezhnaya and anton sikharulidze narrowly won the gold medal over the canadians jamie sale and david pelletier who were later awarded a duplicate gold medal because of the ensuing judging controversy sale and pelletier declined to comment on wednesday the french ice dancers marina anissina and gwendal peizerat later won the gold over a russian team the complaint casts the salt lake city figure skating scandal in a more serious light than the cronyism and voteswapping that have tainted the increasingly troubled sport over the past four years four judges have been suspended including a ukrainian who was taped by a canadian judge detailing the order of finish for the ice dancers before the 1998 winter games in nagano japan if convicted of the charges against him conspiracy to commit wire fraud and conspiracy to commit bribery both felonies tokhtakhounov faces maximum prison time of 10 years and a fine of 500000 or more the united states is seeking his extradition from italy the italian authorities provided the fbi with information from wiretaps of tokhtakhounovs home telephone part of an investigation into his criminal activities the fbi said explicit conversations about the scheme had been recorded between tokhtakhounov and his conspirators and between him and anissina who was born in russia and skated for france and her mother the fbi cited a vivid conversation with anissinas mother in which tokhtakhounov assured her that even if her daughter falls we will make sure she is no 1 after the winter olympics a french judge mariereine le gougne was suspended by the international skating union for not reporting pressure she said was put on her by didier gailhaguet president of the french skating federation to vote for the russian pairs team she later recanted and said that canadian officials had pressured her the isu later suspended le gougne and gailhaguet for three years the federal complaint did not describe the possibility of a wider conspiracy or any contact between tokhtakhounov or his unnamed coconspirators with le gougne we have alleged no connection between this man with any officials other than with russian federation officials james b comey the us attorney for the southern district of new york said at a news conference he said that tokhtakhounov reached out to a coconspirator somebody connected to the russian skating federation who did the legwork for him maxwell miller le gougnes lawyer in salt lake city said no evidence of organized crime influence came up in her suspension hearings before the isu i think this situation vindicates the argument that weve made all along he said shes a scapegoat and a target of a corrupt system and was unfairly singled out tokhtakhounov whose age was given by comey as 53 or 62 is a major figure in international eurasian organized crime comey said born in tashkent uzbekistan and now a russian citizen he is known as taivanchik or little taiwanese for his central asian ethnic background since the collapse of the soviet union he has been implicated in arms trading and russian art smuggling and in the russian news media he was accused of complicity in a plot to extort 10 million from the head of a russian sports foundation he appears to have moved to france in 1989 according to news media reports and is reported to have israeli citizenship also comey said tokhtakhounov had three residences in italy forte dei marmi rome and milan the complaint against tokhtakhounovs traces his contact with figure skating to 2000 when he proposed to gailhaguet the creation of a professional hockey team in paris that would provide revenue for the french skating federation gailhaguet and anissina are not referred to by name in an accompanying fbi agents affidavit but by their descriptions their identities are obvious in return gailhaguet told the fbi on feb 23 as the olympics were taking place tokhtakhounov asked for gailhaguets help in renewing his french visa which was about to expire but when gailhaguet sought guidance from a french government official he was told that tokhtakhounovs money is bad the affidavit said the federal complaint offers many details of the alleged conspiracy including excerpts from a transcript of the italian wiretaps later suspended le gougne and gailhaguet for three years the federal complaint did not describe the possibility of a wider conspiracy or

details of the alleged conspiracy including excerpts from a transcript of the italian wiretaps on feb 5 the italian wiretaps recorded tokhtakhounovs request to someone identified as another russian mobster to get the number of a russian skating federation official the second mobster told tokhtakhounov that the federation official is close to us he is a good guy he will do it tokhtakhounovs action apparently came soon after he said he received a phone call from the mother of the female ice dancer presumably anissina a week later after berezhnaya and sikharulidzes pairs victory the mobsters spoke again the second mobster expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the competition and suggested that tokhtakhounov could call the ice dancers mother or the father and tell them everything will be ok he appears to be referring to anissina the second mobster added our sikharulidze fell the canadians were 10 times better and in spite of that the french with their vote gave us first place he added everything is going the way you need it they also discussed the coming judging in ice dancing in which the french and the italian teams were the favorites the second mobster said the french pair had only three judges and of the two judges they needed to win the gold medal one is ours and the other our friends will give them their concern for lining up more votes than they thought the italian ice dancers had may stem from the italian teams defeat of anissina and peizerat in the 2001 world championships but they seemed pleased that the russian pairs victory was achieved with the french judges vote the french have nothing but the ice dancing the second mobster said again tokhtakhounov voiced his need to have his french visa extended and he said anissina had tried to help him but gailhaguet had thwarted her also on feb 12 a week before the ice dancing finals tokhtakhounov told anissinas mother in a telephone call that the russian federation official had called me from america to assure that we are going to make anissina an olympic champion he told her that the russian skating federation official will help he has two or three judges on or about march 7 in a conversation between tokhtakhounov and anissina she said she would have won the event without his assistance because the russian judge did not vote for her and her partner she also apologized for not calling to thank him earlier but that gailhaguet had forbidden her she told tokhtakhounov that she knew the fbi had interviewed gailhaguet because of information that tokhtakhounov was involved with the results of the ice dancing he assured her that it was nonsense but that gailhaguet knows my name very well he tried to help me and later he made stuff up to scare you so you would not connect me to him even more the conversations seem to indicate a familiarity between tokhtakhounov and anissina tass the official russian news agency reported that anissina attended a ceremony in 1999 at a paris hotel honoring tokhtakhounov for his philanthropy that russian organized crime may have infiltrated international sport at the olympics stunned phyllis howard president of the us figure skating association this is a criminal act and it certainly puts things in a different league howard said lloyd ward chief executive officer of the us olympic committee said in a statement competitors from

other changes by steve lohr c2002 new york times news service east fishkill ny ibm opened a sprawling and sophisticated semiconductor factory here on wednesday that cost more than 25 billion to build and equip the largest single capital investment the company has ever made the factory which opens as the computer chip business is in a slump is a costly and risky move for ibm but it is also an expression of confidence by the company that it can remain a technology leader in the highly competitive global semiconductor industry and a commitment that the best place to execute that strategy is in upstate new york ibm is an exception among computer makers in that it still invests heavily in research to advance the design manufacture and materials used in semiconductor chips it is spending more than 500 million a year on semiconductor research and development the factory will produce a wide range of specialized semiconductors used in everything from the largest mainframe computers to cell phones and videogame consoles the new plant is part of ibms push to gain a strong lead in chipmaking beyond the personal computer business where intel and east asian chip producers hold the advantage the core of our strategy is to lead in technology and attack the highperformance segments of the market said john kelly senior vice president in charge of ibms technology group an advantage to having the semiconductor fabricating factory here kelly explained was that it was very close to its research laboratories in nearby westchester county ny to stay ahead in advanced chip technology he said moving innovations out of the labs and into the factory as fast as possible is crucial what we call the labtofab time should be as close to zero as possible kelly said if our strategy were anything but to be on the leading edge wed have put the plant in asia the new factory which will begin normal production early next year will employ about 1000 people begin optional trim in remarks during a ribboncutting ceremony here on wednesday gov george e pataki said he expected the facility to generate thousands more jobs in the hudson valley area for contractors and suppliers catering to the factory he praised ibm for being a critical partner in our economic development efforts in new york state in a brief speech samuel j palmisano ibms chief executive emphasized that it was important to make longterm investments despite the current slump in the technology business to play to win in technology you innovate and you lead he said but manufacturing technology products is a costly and cyclical business in june ibm announced that it was taking a charge of more than 2 billion against earnings the largest single reasons for the charge were the cost of getting out of the business of manufacturing hard disks for storage which it sold to hitachi and closing down some of its older semiconductor operations but kelly said the demand for advanced chips like those produced at ibms facility in burlington vt is strong i need more capacity in that end of the market he said and this is factory is critical to meeting that growing demand if ibm has miscalculated the demand it will suffer badly as both the high operating costs and depreciation on the huge capital investment for the east fishkill factory drag down earnings but industry analysts said the plant should be insulated from a falloff in one or a few segments of the semiconductor market end optional trim the factory is highly automated and designed to shift flexibly to produce many different kinds of chips to suit demand the diversity is the big difference with this plant said richard doherty president of envisioneering a research firm it gives ibm the capability to make so many different kinds of custom chips and the world is going to custom chips the 140000squarefoot plant is a testament to advanced manufacturing technology the 300millimeter silicon wafers about the size of a standard pizza are shuttled around the facility in enclosed plastic pods which ride on overhead tracks they drop down from wires automatically into machines sheathed in stainless steel and glass for each stage of processing and fabrication throughout the 500 processing steps which typically last 20 days the wafers are not touched by human hands the circuits etched into the chips are less than one thousandth the width of a human hair human operators are there to monitor the systems catch errors and finetune the production process for maximum efficiency because each of the hundreds of processing machines is selfenclosed and essentially airtight the uniforms operators wear are less constricting than in the previous generation of chip plants which looked like space suits the operators at the east fishkill factory wear light nylon uniforms light blue shoe coverings and translucent hair nets made of paper they look more like workers in a bakery yes said richard brilla director of the new facility but the donuts are a lot more costly here each wafer holding hundreds of chips is worth 6000 to 10000 apiece depending on what insulation circuitry and materials are used nyt073102 2338edt

hersh have laid out is not exactly a seniorcitizen routine even though child has always been candid about her age and realistic in assessing her own capabilities when the pasadena native moved back to california from her longtime home in the boston area last year she also made the move from a condominium she and her late husband paul had purchased many years ago to a progressive retirement home she is in the most active of the four levels available but should the need arise she can move on to assisted living facilities within the same complex julia explains hersh made these retirement plans many years ago she thinks its selfish for people not to make arrangements for their old age in good time but so far age has been kind to the ebullient child in a phone interview a couple of weeks ago she

threepantry kitchen paul child designed for their house in cambridge that may well be the bestknown kitchen in america since it became the site of the french chef television programs which started airing in 1962 back there we always ate in the kitchen child reminisced i cannot do that here that means her entertaining has been curtailed even though she still has an active social life with the many friends the childs made during 22 winters spent in santa barbara she will have reunions of sorts with her famous kitchen in the next few weeks one of its pegboard walls was dismantled and reinstalled at copia the rest went to washington dc and the behring center of the smithsonian institutions national museum of american history all cq hersh recalls the museum staffs approach to preserving the famous kitchen as awesome they cataloged and photographed everything from stove to windows blinds to drawer contents as reinstalled in washington the kitchen should be as we all remember it from countless tv shows right down to the toothpicks child will go to the capital for the debut of the exhibit right after the maine birthday bash to see her kitchen and by extension herself enshrined in the smithsonian she said will be an odd feeling and no doubt bring back memories but child is not one to get maudlin about the past though she does want to keep it alive shes

seeds of her culinary career were sown fresh off the boat on their way to paris and paul childs new posting they had met in sri lanka during world war ii they stopped for lunch in rouen that lunch lit

issues of the day fisheries management its no longer unusual for chefs to refuse to serve a species they think to be at risk of extinction or for a retailer to promote seafoods that are abundant and part of a healthy marine ecosystem most say theyre driven by the desire to do right by the environment some also say they must listen to their customers concerns or risk a consumer backlash the nationwide boycott of chilean seabass is a potent example of the new activism i have made it a policy of mine never to serve chilean seabass said billy hahn executive chef at jakes famous crawfish a portland ore landmark since 1892 i refuse to sell it chilean seabass also known as patagonian toothfish came into vogue in the 1990s in us restaurants and fish markets with rising demand for the firm oilrich fish came pirate fishing fleets eager to cash in on its popularity even if it meant skirting catch limits and environmental regulations contrary to what some restaurants and retailers tell their customers the us government does not consider the chilean seabass to be endangered but in some areas the seabass are being overfished that is potentially a problem because chilean seabass are a longlived species living as long as 50 years and reproduce slowly said susan buchanan a spokeswoman for the federal governments national marine fisheries service the nmfs estimates that in 2000 more than 16000 tons of chilean seabass were legally caught from an internationally regulated harvest area in the antarctic ocean but more than 32000 tons may have been taken illegally from those same waters the fisheries service said impatient with regulators the national environmental trust began a boycott campaign in february called take a pass on chilean seabass the washingtonbased conservation group says more than 530 restaurants have signed on a number of restaurants not officially part of the national environmental trust boycott also have stopped serving chilean seabass and its not just the white tablecloth crowd red lobster with 660 restaurants in the united states and canada dropped chilean seabass from the menu in the past year because of sustainability concerns said wendy spirduso communications director for the orlando flabased chain some retailers also have pulled chilean seabass weve discontinued selling swordfish chilean seabass orange roughy and marlin said mark cockcroft national seafood buyer for wild oats markets a chain of 103 stores we are also taking a real hard look currently at almost all species of shark though we havent made a formal statement about that whole foods markets with 133 stores nationwide also does not sell chilean seabass all of this comes at a time when americans are consuming more seafood 15 to 16 pounds per person each year compared with 103 pounds per person in 1960 and 125 pounds in 1980 according to the national fisheries institute an industry association at the same time about half the worlds fisheries are being fished to capacity the food and agriculture organization of the united nations reports that 47 percent to 50 percent of stocks are fully exploited meaning that catches have either reached or are close to maximum limits another 15 percent to 18 percent are overexploited and 9 percent to 10 percent have been depleted or are recovering from depletion the seafood industry is less than thrilled about this surge of interest in ocean ecosystems from people who are not scientists fisheries management is best left to the experts said thor lassen president of ocean trust a research and conservation foundation partly financed by the fishing industry it involves very complicated choices that have to do with the biology of species their life cycles how they respond to various changes in the oceans etc when theres a boycott lassen said its not environmentalists or chefs making the sacrifice its coastal communities rod moore executive director of the west coast seafood processors association suggests that activists with an agenda are manipulating chefs and retailers the conservation groups providing information to chefs and retailers and lists of environmentally appropriate seafoods to consumers are the same groups working to affect fisheries management on the political and regulatory level moore said thats simply good strategy said james leape deputy director of the conservation program for the david and lucile packard foundation in los altos calif in 2000 and 2001 the packard foundation awarded 26 million in marine fisheries conservation grants they included support for marine reserves and money for fisheries management reform more than 7 million was given to projects aimed at educating the general public one of the principal concerns of the packard foundation is the preservation of natural resources particularly in the oceans and one of the greatest threats is overfishing leape said we have seen that raising consumer awareness and concern among restaurants and retailers about a particular fishery can really make a difference optional trim follows the monterey bay aquariums web site rates different species of fish for overfishing habitat damage and other factors the california aquarium also created seafood watch wallet cards designed to take to restaurants more than 600000 of the cards and seafood guides have been distributed since 2000 said jennifer dianto seafood watch program manager at the aquarium chefs and retailers around the country know they must be prepared to deal with customers who arrive with the aquariums seafood card in hand but in a business in which 12hour shifts are the norm some chefs worry about their lack of time to stay informed about complicated rapidly changing fisheries management issues some working chefs say they routinely review conservation group web sites government reports and industry sources for me its very difficult to be certain that the information which is given to me is real said eric ripert chef at le bernardin a fourstar seafood restaurant in manhattan i dont know i dont have enough information to know for example if chilean seabass is really disappearing or if its political pressure despite being uncertain of its status ripert pulled chilean seabass le bernardins menu also informs diners that the restaurant will not serve swordfish to support efforts to recover the species i dont wish to be a spokesman for any campaign ripert said i do it as somebody who has a conscience and is caring jl end cole michelle cole is a staff writer for the oregonian of portland ore she can be contacted at

becoming a client of this service contact the new york times syndicate sales representatives listed at the end of the text by christine soares c2002 scientific american intending to ease consumer access to mental health care new mexico legislators in march passed a law allowing psychologists to prescribe psychotropic medications such as antidepressants the states action the first in the nation has the blessing of the american psychological association apa which considers prescriptive authority a logical extension of psychologists role as healthcare providers but powerful groups including the american medical association oppose the idea and have a surprising source of support psychologists themselves some of whom call it a radical experiment and fear that the most likely victim will be the science of psychology i am concerned that nonmedically trained people as legitimate prescribers of drugs will not be accepted by the american public says psychologist gerald c davison of the university of southern california the apa has spent more than 1 million to help state psychological associations develop and lobby for such prescription privileges or rxp legislation a total of 31 state psychology associations have task forces dedicated to developing and lobbying for prescriptionprivileges legislation the version endorsed by the apa would license doctorallevel psychologists to independently prescribe psychotropic drugs after completing 300 hours of classroom instruction in neuroscience physiology and pharmacology followed by four months supervised treatment of 100 patients critics say that is not nearly enough compared with other prescribers such as md psychiatrists or nurse practitioners who have at least six years medical education and clinical experience neither davison nor most other rxp opponents doubt the efficacy of medications their greatest objection is to the notion of turning psychology into a prescribing profession in a field that has struggled long and hard to prove that mind mood and behavior can be studied empirically the past decade davison says has seen exciting developments that demonstrate the validity of various psychotherapeutic interventions and the psychosocialbehavioral models on which they are based the timing is peculiar to abandon psychological science or to convert it to a medical science explains elaine m heiby of the university of hawaii who chairs a committee of the 1000member american association of applied and preventive psychology that is concerned about the medicalization of psychology making sure that practicing psychologists are giving patients interventions based on the best available psychological science should be the apas priority argues emory universitys scott lilienfeld president of the society for a science of clinical psychology sscp more than any philosophical betrayal of psychology rxp opponents fear that the movement will undermine the science they love they believe that if prescriptive authority becomes the norm biomedical requirements will inevitably seep into the psychology curriculum at the expense of traditional psychological science and methodology lilienfeld feels that many clinical psychologists already receive inadequate training in fundamentals such as research design and evaluation rxp opponents charge the apa with pushing its prescriptionprivileges agenda without adequately assessing support for it in the field the 300member sscp is the only group within the apa to have taken a formal stance against prescription privileges the apa has scheduled 30 minutes at its meeting in august for an rxp debate but its leadership believes it already has an accurate sense of support for its rxp policy except for this small vocal minority we have just not gotten a lot of groundswell against this from members says apa president philip g zimbardo of stanford university with prescription privileges now a reality in one state some rxp opponents concede that it may be too late this year four states besides new mexico georgia hawaii illinois and tennessee have pending legislation for psychologist prescription privileges over the past decade 14 state legislatures have considered such laws between 1991 and 1997 a us department of defense psychopharmacology demonstration project involving two to four years training produced 10 military psychologists

destiny but not everyone wanted to cooperate karnes sat in his woodpaneled office in a quonset hut in the middle of the great salt lake desert a black telephone to his ear he was tracking down men to join a group so secret he couldnt admit it existed on his metal desk were names of military men being ordered into the organization he was calling bases all over the united states to line up their transfer to the desert outside salt lake city where is the authority asked one officer who didnt want to lose a valuable man under his command who says this another commanding officer asked karnes each time karnes said what he had to call air force headquarters if you dont believe me if they continued to resist he pulled out a secret code for their bosses this is a silverplate request he said silverplate code word for the historic mission that would end world war ii almost 1800 men were assembled n late 1944 to join the topsecret unit called the 509th composite group col paul tibbets the pilot who would drop the worlds first atomic bomb over hiroshima japan was commander of the unit and chose the men and the first person he chose to join him was karnes though he couldnt reveal the mission to karnes karnes 87 is a retired history professor who lives in suburban austin with his wife virginia who also worked for the 509th as a civilian bookkeeper for six months karnes was tibbets adjutant the man in charge of writing the orders and cajoling the transfer to the unit of servicemen proficient in bombing mechanics ordnance engineering and communications tibbets picked the names and karnes made it happen tibbets hated paperwork karnes thought it was a breeze they were a wartime match that changed the world japan surrendered within days of the detonation of the atomic bombs that killed 140000 people in hiroshima on aug 6 1945 and 70000 in nagasaki three days later the story of the 509th is a tale of an elite outfit that lived in a bubble of secrecy and endured the taunts of other warweary us units that resented sharing a small pacific island with the 509th which appeared exempt from combat tinian island was the staging area where the 509th moved after its creation in the desert karnes has never spoken publicly about his role as tibbets righthand administrative aide he never even told his story to students in his 40 years of teaching college war is hell he says and when it was over he wanted to come home and rejoin his young family and not dwell on it he earned a doctorate in history from stanford university and taught latin american history at tulane university and arizona state university next week marks the 57th anniversary of the atomic bombings as always karnes mind will drift to memories of his good friend tibbets 87 who lives in columbus ohio each year on aug 6 i always think of paul tibbets and how he handled unbelievable responsibility karnes said karnes met tibbets when the 29yearold bomber pilot walked into karnes office at wendover army air field on the utahnevada border karnes was the personnel and classification officer he was only a captain but he had been left in charge at wendover the day tibbets surprised them by landing a b29 a new plane no one at wendover had seen tibbets had just been ordered to organize a combat force to drop a bomb being developed by a secret enterprise known as the manhattan project he was searching for a remote installation to train bomber crews and support units in total secrecy tibbets instantly liked the isolation and vast size of wendover and the surrounding bonneville salt flats and he immediately liked karnes who showed him around the base in karnes tibbets found a kindred spirit and a handball partner both were smart disciplined quiet men who thrived on efficiency perfection and selfreliance each had skills the other admired tibbets was a decorated topgun pilot but karnes could wrangle the military rule book as well as tibbets could fly i dont recall ever having to tell tom to do anything tibbets said in an email this week he was so knowledgeable he just got things done allowing me to concentrate on other matters i was very lucky to have tom tibbets quickly returned to wendover after that first visit to set up his headquarters his first order appointed karnes adjutant for the 509th almost overnight wendover became a highsecurity base filled with offlimit areas covered in barbed wire no one was allowed to talk about what they saw or heard even though most of the 509th had no idea why they were there except that 15 b29s were being modified to carry a heavy load karnes and his staff read outgoing mail to make sure no secrets slipped out karnes hated to pry and skimmed over personal portions of the letters phone calls were monitored an undercover force of manhattan project security agents infiltrated the base and bars in the little town of wendover population 103 to spy on airmen karnes knew the 509th was preparing for a special bombing mission but he had no idea what kind of bombs were involved i had a friend the finance officer he said that they had split the atom and that we were going to drop an atomic bomb karnes said i said no a noncommittal mmmmm was the most karnes could ever get out of tibbets on matters of the bomb by spring the 509th prepared to move to tinian island near guam and saipan that would put the b29s about 1500 miles from japan a 13hour roundtrip flight karnes was deluged with orders for inoculations equipment transfers and promotions karnes arrived on tinian on may 18 1945 as part of an advance team that flew in the five c54 transport planes of the 509th on may 29 1200 men arrived on the troopship cape victory after a fiveweek trip from seattle tinian island had been captured from japan and the seabees the construction arm of the navy had built two large airfields the 509th took north field and stayed in relative isolation from other b29 units on the island karnes handed out bunk assignments choosing the mess officer chuck perry to share his tent karnes had his own jeep and went to the beach and to evening movies shown by other units as often as he could but at the movies he had to remove the distributor cap on his jeep so the vehicle wouldnt be stolen perhaps by jealous airmen who resented the 509th not until the day before tibbets and his crew flew to hiroshima was the 509th told what was happening the word spread this is it this is the big mission karnes and hundreds of other men from the 509th stood along the flight line as tibbets and the enola gay took off at 245 am on aug 6 a warm tropical night three b29s had gone ahead to check the weather at hiroshima and two other possible bomb sites two other b29s left in twominute intervals after tibbets so their crews could take photos and drop devices to measure radiation and other effects of the bomb tibbets got the word only an hour from hiroshima that the citys weather was clear as they approached tibbets braced for japanese antiaircraft fire none came early in the flight the crew had inserted a plug of uranium into the 9000pound bomb nicknamed little boy ninety seconds from the bomb drop tibbets put the plane on autopilot the crew slipped on dark glasses to prepare for the blinding flash of the bomb at 815 am hiroshima time the pneumatic bombbay doors opened and little boy equivalent to 20000 tons of tnt fell out tibbets and his crew had exactly 43 seconds to get away before the bomb exploded the enola gay climbed and tibbets fought to turn the plane in the airbending 155degree the crews had been practicing off tinian for months he pushed off the dark glasses because he couldnt see to fly when the bomb exploded as planned 1890 feet over hiroshima tibbets mouth tingled and he tasted the lead fillings in his teeth a minute later the shock wave hit the crew was horrified by the purple mushroom cloud that climbed to 10 miles and looked as if it would engulf the enola gay more shocking was the city of hiroshima which was on fire and bubbling like tar we were all appalled the pilot said in his book the tibbets story back on tinian karnes had gone to bed but he didnt sleep long someone woke him to say gen hap arnold chief of the army air forcesin washington was on the phone and asking for him arnold told karnes tibbets is going to be landing in three to four hours and i want to give him the distinguished service cross and it is your job to write up the explanation i had no idea how you wrote up an award id never written up any award karnes said so i got all of my sergeants out and theyre all digging through their books when an unsuspecting tibbets descended from the enola gay on tinian he barely managed to palm his pipe as gen carl spaatz commander of the strategic air forces stepped forward to pin the medal on his bomb flight coveralls karnes like the hundreds of others gathered along the flight line was jubilant he knew the war would soon be over and he would be heading home a yearof secrecy and hard work wasover three days later another b29 from the 509th bombed nagasaki five days later japan surrendered and world war ii was over today karnes is frustrated that some of his fellow historians the ones he calls revisionists question the wisdom and morality of the bombings what matters he believes is that his generation thought the bomb should be dropped we were not bloodthirsty guys he said we were convinced then and i still am that we ended the war a year or two earlier and what the casualties would have been who knows but heavy on tinian and probably elsewhere the seabees were building enormous hospitals while we were there he said those hospitals were not for us they were for an expected invasion of japan and then the casualties were going to be terrible karnes carries the image of hundreds of hospital beds in his mind in his heart he holds the unshakable conviction that the mission he helped organize saved america from disaster denise gamino

 electronic theft by foreign and industrial spies and disgruntled employees is costing us companies billions and eroding their international competitive advantage that was the message delivered by government and private security experts at an allday conference on corporate electronic espionage hostile and even friendly nations routinely steal information from us companies and share it with their own companies said noel d matchett a former staffer at the federal national security agency and now president of information security inc silver spring md it may well be that theft of business data is as serious a strategic threat to national security as it is a threat to the survival of victimized us firms said michelle van cleave the white houses assistant director for national security affairs the conference was jointly sponsored by the new york institute of technology school of management and the armed forces communications and electronics association a joint industrygovernment trade group any secret can be pirated the experts said if it is transmitted over the air even rank amateurs can do it if they spend a few thousand dollars for a commercially available microwave receiver with amplifier and a vcr recorder they need only position themselves near a companys satellite dish and wait you can have a dozen competitors stealing your secrets at the same time mr matchett said adding its a pretty good bet they wont get caught the only way to catch an electronic thief he said is to set him up with erroneous information even though electronic espionage may cost us firms billions of dollars a year most arent yet taking precautions the experts said by contrast european firms will spend 150 million this year on electronic security and are expected to spend 1 billion by 1992 already many foreign firms especially banks have their own cryptographers conference speakers reported still encrypting corporate communications is only a partial remedy one expert whose job is so politically sensitive that he spoke on condition that he wouldnt be named or quoted said the expected influx of east european refugees over the next few years will greatly increase the chances of computermaintenance workers for example doubling as foreign spies moreover he said technology now exists for stealing corporate secrets after theyve been erased from a computers memory he said that oliver north of irancontra notoriety thought he had erased his computer but that the information was later retrieved for congressional committees to read no personal computer not even the one on a chief executives desk is safe this speaker noted w mark goode president of micronyx inc a richardson texas firm that makes computersecurity products provided a new definition for mikhail gorbachevs campaign for greater openness known commonly as glasnost under mr gorbachev mr goode said the soviets are openly stealing western corporate communications he cited the case of a swiss oil trader who recently put out bids via telex for an oil tanker to pick up a cargo of crude in the middle east among the responses the swiss trader got was one from the soviet national shipping company which hadnt been invited to submit a bid the soviets eavesdropping paid off however because they got the contract 
we dont know who is winning the drug war in latin america but we know whos losing it the press over the past six months six journalists have been killed and 10 kidnapped by drug traffickers or leftist guerrillas who often are one and the same in colombia over the past 12 years at least 40 journalists have died there the attacks have intensified since the colombian government began cracking down on the traffickers in august trying to prevent their takeover of the country the slaughter in colombia was very much on the minds of 450 editors and publishers from latin america the united states the caribbean and canada attending the 45th general assembly of the interamerican press association in monterrey mexico this week on tuesday the conference got word of another atrocity the assassination in medellin of two employees of el espectador colombias secondlargest newspaper the papers local administrator maria luz lopez was shot dead and her mother wounded while her car was stopped for a red light an hour later the papers circulation manager miguel soler was shot and killed near his home the drug lords who claimed responsibility said they would blow up the bogota newspapers offices if it continued to distribute in medellin they bombed the bogota offices last month destroying its computer and causing 25 million in damage el espectador has been a special target because of the extraordinary courage of its publisher and his staff at monterrey publisher luis gabriel cano although shaken by the murders issued a statement saying we will not cease our fight against drug trafficking they want to terrify the press and in particular el espectador because it has always been a torchbearer in this war this comes from a man whose brother guillermo was murdered in 1986 the publishers in monterrey command no battalions but they agreed to express their outrage with editorials in todays editions many will use a common editorial a final statement yesterday said while some advances are being made in nations throughout the hemisphere the state of press freedom in the americas still must be regarded as grim as long as journalists and their families are subject to the crudest form of censorship death by assassination the report charged that panamas manuel noriega is not only in league with the drug traffickers but also is bullying the press as never before noriega has closed every independent newspaper radio and television station and arrested tortured or forced into exile a long list of reporters the statement declared it added in cuba public enemy no 1 of press freedoms in the hemisphere repression of journalists both cuban and foreign is worse than ever and in nicaragua promises of press freedom by the sandinistas have not materialized as it happens the four countries cited colombia cuba panama and nicaragua are not only where the press is under greatest attack but also are linked by the drug trade and leftwing politics noriega is close to castro and may once have been his agent sandinistas thomas borge and the ortega brothers are castro proteges he backed their takeover of nicaragua in colombia the drugfinanced guerrillas trying to seize the country and destroy democracy include m19 which castro has clearly backed robert merkel a former us attorney handling drug indictments in florida doesnt think for a minute that castros much publicized trials of high officials engaged in the drug trade mean he has broken off with the medellin drug cartel if the cartel succeeds in blackmailing the colombian authorities into negotiations the cartel will be in control and fidel can exploit his past relationships with them he told the journals david asman recently the struggle against the drug lords in colombia will be a near thing this week the government arrested jose abello silva said to be the fourthranking cartel leader he will probably be extradited to the us for trial under an extradition treaty president virgilia barco has revived later another highranking trafficker leonidas vargas was arrested and 1000 pounds of dynamite seized mr barco has refused us troops or advisers but has accepted us military aid president bush has agreed to meet within 90 days with mr barco president alan garcia of peru and president jaime paz zamora of bolivia to discuss the drug problem it might not be a bad idea to do that sooner rather than later after the panama fiasco they will need some reassurance certainly the colombian press is much in need of that 
 deformation and river response before specific examples of syntectonic impacts on alluvial rivers can be discussed a brief review of types of tectonic activity types of rivers and river response will be presented this background material sets the stage for detailed discussions that follow types of deformation the surficial movements in an alluvial valley can take different forms as illustrated in figure 21 the displacement can be seismic and associated with earthquakes and abrupt faulting or it can be aseismic with progressive tilting and warping of the valley floor faults may be lateral faults that displace or offset the channel figure 21a without vertical displacement this type of displacement should be easily recognized faults with vertical displacement may have the uplifted block upstream of the fault with the result that gradient is steepened figure 21b in the opposite case the gradient will be decreased figure 21c the effect will resemble monoclinal tilting figure 21f g pairs of faults may produce uplifted horst or downdropped blocks graben that will both steepen and reduce gradient figure 21d e this has the same effect as domes and anticlines or basins and synclines figure 21h i in addition to all of these structural features the entire valley may be tilted upstream or downstream or the tilting may be across the valley toward either side of the floodplain figure 21j k l the possibilities are great but in reality the result will be local steepening or reduction of gradient or crossvalley tilting streams respond to vertical displacement along faults figure 21b and c by aggradation or degradation when the displacement produces a channel segment steeper than the original stream gradient figure 21b erosion will be initiated in this reach when the displacement produces a channel segment of lower elevation or gradient than the original stream figure 21c aggradation will occur even small displacements may be sufficient to induce aggradation or degradation of large streams if the displacement forms a dam figure 21c the stream will be blocked and it will flow along the fault or form a lake wallace 1968 mentioned that even a few inches of vertical upthrow along the downstream side of a fault can produce a dam across a small stream which can divert its course null figure 21 surface deformation by faulting folding and lateral tilting plan view on left crosssection on right from ouchi 1983 small arrows indicate direction of flow large arrows indicate direction of movement the displacement in each case is greatly exaggerated horst and graben figure 21d and e combine two different types of vertical displacement figure 21b and c there will be aggradation upstream from the horst and degradation which will migrate upstream on the downstream part of the horst reduced sediment supply because of aggradation upstream will enhance the downstream degradation upstream of the graben there will be degradation and aggradation in the graben itself a river in such a location will be unstable as cartier and alt 1982 suggested for the bitterroot river in montana the type of folding figure 21 will affect a river similar to the various types of faulting but changes will probably be less abrupt the effects of tilting will depend upon the amount but in the simplest case steepening of a valley will cause degradation figure 21k and a reverse tilt figure 21l will cause deposition lateral tilting will cause channel shift downdip figure 21j or avulsion figure 21 shows only simple but exaggerated cases whereas actual displacements can be more complicated for example faults can take any angle from parallel to perpendicular to river flow direction fault displacements of the surface at the time of an earthquake are obvious and its influence on alluvial rivers can be observed for example small stream channels have been offset by strikeslip movement figures 18 21a of the san andreas fault wallace 1968 pointed out that the offset of a stream channel depends on the relative rates of fluvial and tectonic processes the main reason why channel offset caused by the san andreas fault is clear is the extremely high rate of displacement along the fault 203 mmyear brown and wallace 1968 and the relatively small size of streams crossing and flowing along the fault while fault displacements are obvious movements of the land surface by folding can be slow however this type of deformation can also be an important influence on river behavior for example concentration of erosion along only one river bank can be the result of lateral tilt jefferson 1907 nanson 1980a leeder and alexander 1987 types of alluvial rivers it is apparent that different types of alluvial channels will respond differently to deformation therefore their characteristics must be reviewed before their response can be evaluated this can best be done by discussing a simple classification of alluvial channels that is based on type of sediment load and pattern five basic channel patterns exist figure 22 1 straight channels with either migrating sand waves or 2 with migrating alternate bars forming a sinuous thalweg 3 two types of meandering channels a highly sinuous channel of equal width pattern 3a and channels that are wider at bends than in crossings pattern 3b 4 the meanderingbraided transition and 5 a typical braided stream the relative stability of these channels in terms of their normal erosional activity and the shape and gradient of the channels as related to relative sediment size load velocity of flow and stream power are also indicated in figure 22 it has been possible to develop these patterns experimentally by varying the gradient sediment load stream power and the type of sediment load transported by the channel schumm and kahn 1972 therefore alluvial channels have also been classified according to the type of sediment load moving through the channels as suspendedload mixedload and bedload channels figure 22 water discharge determines the dimensions of the channel width depth meander dimensions but the relative proportions of bed load sand and gravel and suspended load silts and clays determine not only the shape of the channel but widthdepth ratio and channel pattern a suspendedload channel has been defined as one that transports less than 3 percent bed load and a bedload channel as one transporting more than 11 percent bed load schumm 1977 the mixedload channel lies between these two figure 22 null figure 22 channel classification based on pattern and type of sediment load with associated variables and relative stability indicated schumm 1981 alluvial rivers that transport clay silt sand and gravel can be placed within these three general categories however within the meanderingstream group there is considerable range of sinuosity 125 to 30 in addition in the braidedstream category there are barbraided and islandbraided channels islands are vegetated bars figure 22 suggests that the range of channels from straight to braided forms a continuum but experimental work and field studies have indicated that the changes of pattern between braided meandering and straight occur relatively abruptly at riverpattern thresholds figure 23 the pattern changes take place at critical values of stream power gradient and sediment load schumm and kahn 1972 null figure 23 relation between flume slope and sinuosity during experiments at constant water discharge sediment load stream power velocity increase with flume slope and a similar relation can be developed with these variables from schumm and khan 1972 although the five patterns of figure 22 involve all three river types there are five basic bedload channel patterns figure 24a that have been recognized during experimental studies of channel patterns schumm 1977 p 158 these five basic bedload channel patterns can be extended to mixedload and suspendedload channels to produce 13 river patterns figure 24 patterns 15 are bedload channel patterns patterns 610 are mixedload channel patterns and patterns 1113 are suspendedload channel patterns figure 24 attempts to show sinuosity differences and how the pattern thresholds change with increasing valley slope stream power and sediment load for each channel type the three major river types are controlled by type of sediment load but within each type the different patterns reflect increased valley slope sediment load and stream power the different bedload channel patterns figure 24 can be described as follows pattern 1 straight essentially equalwidth channel with migrating sand waves pattern 2 alternatebar channel with migrating side or alternate bars and a slightly sinuous thalweg pattern 3 lowsinuosity meandering channel with large alternate bars that develop chutes pattern 4 transitional meanderingthalweg braided channel the large alternate bars or point bars have been dissected by chutes but a meandering thalweg can be identified pattern 5 is a typical barbraided channel as compared to the bedload channels the five mixedload channels figure 24b are relatively narrower and deeper and there is greater bank stability the higher degree of bank stability permits the maintenance of narrow deep straight channels pattern 6 and alternate bars stabilize because of the finer sediments to form slightly sinuous channels pattern 7 pattern 8 is a truly meandering channel wide on the bends relatively narrow at the crossings and subject to chute cutoffs pattern 9 maintains the sinuosity of a meandering channel but with a greater sediment transport the presence of bars gives it a composite sinuousbraided appearance pattern 10 is a braided channel that is relatively more stable than that of bedload channel 5 and it is likely to be islandbraided null figure 24 the range of alluvial channel patterns for the three channel types a bedload channel patterns b mixedload channel patterns c suspendedload channel patterns from schumm 1981 suspendedload channels figure 24c are narrow and deeper than mixedload channels suspended load pattern 11 is a straight narrow deep channel with only small quantities of bed load this type of channel may have the highest sinuosity of all patterns 12 and 13 rivers may undergo a metamorphosis during which the channel morphology changes completely that is a suspendedload channel pattern 12 could become braided pattern 5 or a braided channel pattern 5 could become meandering pattern 8 or 12 etc when there is a sufficiently great change in the type of sediment load transported through that channel therefore the change from one type of channel pattern to another may be relatively common as the nature of the sediment moved through the system changes and this may be the effect of tributary sediment contributions or upstream degradation or aggradation or tectonics there is an additional channel pattern that spans the range of stream types of figure 24 this is the anastomosing pattern of branching and rejoining channel segments schumm et al 1996 the channel segments can be straight meandering or braided and they appear to span the range of channel types anastomosing or anabranching channels differ from braided channels because they are composed of multiple channels that are separated by a floodplain figure 25 whereas braided channels have multiple thalwegs in a single channel knighton and nanson 1993 and richards et al 1993 suggest that this pattern is transitioned to a single channel because anastomosing rivers appear to be associated with partly blocked valleys smith and smith 1980 and tectonic uplift gregory and schumm 1987 reduced gradient from whatever cause appears to be important and therefore anastomosing reaches of a river can be evidence of tectonic activity evidence of deformation the first geomorphic clues of active tectonics may be tectonic landforms that result from longcontinued deformation such as modified drainage networks and deformed sets of terraces these obvious features are in contrast to the more subtle changes of alluvial rivers drainage networks the arrangement of streams and tributaries into a drainage network is affected by the regional slope of the surface on which the pattern develops climate and the erodibility of the surface material local variations in both slope and materials will cause variations in the drainage pattern figure 12 for example experimental studies demonstrated that parallel drainage patterns form on slopes greater than about 25 percent whereas dendritic patterns form on gentler slopes phillips and schumm 1987 null figure 25 map of anastomosing channels of ovens and king rivers numbers indicate relative ages of channels and reaches of channels from youngest 1 to oldest 4 from schumm et al 1996 local variations in regional surface slope can cause anomalous drainage patterns a topographic high caused by active uplift will cause a deflection of portions of the drainage pattern for instance on the upslope side of an uplift the local surface slope will be opposite that of the regional slope this can cause portions of the drainage pattern to develop in a direction opposite to that of the drainage network an uplift may also deflect portions of the drainage from the general direction of the regional slope figure 26 as the major streams are deflected away from the uplift tributaries on one side will be lengthened and those on the other side will be shortened changes of an entire drainage network as a result of tilting are described by sparling 1967 who notes that isostatic adjustment in ottawa county ohio has increased the gradient of some streams and decreased the gradient of others incision of the steepened streams permitted them to capture the streams that were aggrading as a result of reduced gradient russell 1939 described various drainage patterns found in the flat alluvial lands of louisiana and he recognized a network pattern of poorly developed drainage channels that was converted to a dendritic pattern as a result of tilting and steepening of the gradient null figure 26 drainage pattern modified by uplift price and whetstone 1977 used asymmetric river and valley crosssection profiles as evidence for movement along the chattahoochee embayment in florida subsidence caused southward migration of eastwest flowing channels southflowing streams exhibit paired terraces while eastwest trending streams contain extensive terraces on the northern side with few or no terraces on the steeper southern margin subsidence in the chattahoochee embayment and adjacent warping along the chattahoochee uplift resulted in asymmetrical incision along the chattahoochee river longcontinued tilting in a crossvalley direction will cause lateral erosion and the development of an asymmetrical valley and drainage network muehlberger 1979 noted this type of asymmetry in an area near taos new mexico figure 27 using 71minute us geological survey topographic 2 maps he described this asymmetry quantitatively by selecting a contour on the valley wall and measuring the distance from the stream to this contour in a downtilt direction dd and in the opposite uptilt direction du an index of asymmetry was developed dddu figure 27 the index for 30 small drainage basins was 06 indicating a major displacement of the main channel in a downtilt direction cox 1994 used a somewhat different index to demonstrate tilting and river shift in the southwestern mississippi embayment other indices of asymmetry are described by keller and pinter 1996

1979 lake patterns lakes are temporary features in terms of geological time but they can be clear evidence of deformation they occur at various scales along primary or secondary portions of the drainage network and generally disappear as erosion and deposition occurs through time they may be isolated but they are more frequently clustered in a specific area or they are aligned along specific trends isolated lakes are generally due to local events such as landslides or collapses which form a dam but clustered lakes are due to regional processes which may be related to climate or paleoclimate neotectonic deformation or frequently a combination of these processes large lakes may occupy geological basins and active tectonics is partly or totally involved in their formation such lakes act as drainage collectors and they can occupy various elevations the bolivian altiplano lakes titicaca popoo uyuni stand at an elevation of around 4000 m and are associated with plate convergence and uplift continental stretching and transtensional tectonics are favorable for the formation of basins and tectonic lakes often the relation of lakes to faults is obvious and a study of the lake pattern is not necessary to demonstrate the effect of tectonics see chapter 5 where reelfoot lake and the mississippi valley sunklands are described figures 51 52 null figure 28 inferred fault zone in the area of the tupinambaranas in the amazon basin between obidos and manaus brazil modified after sternberg 1955 the river trace and ria lakes suggest a downward movement along the same axis as that of the inferred fault this discussion deals with cases where specific lake patterns ria lakes and elongated lakes are related to active deformation most of these concepts are not new for example the significance of ria lakes was identified more than 30 years ago ria lakes dendritic ria lakes occur at the lower part of a tributary which is blocked by aggradation along the trunk river

the maran basin ucamara depression but ria lakes occur again in the ucayali basin of central peru figure 210 a piggyback basin a continental rift generates tilt of the side blocks in opposite directions and the progressive tilting of the earths surface can significantly modify the gradient of rivers for example lake victoria is drained by the victoria nile which flows north to lake kyoga figure 211 lake kyoga and lake kwania look artificial but they are not the result of dam construction they are in fact formed by uplift and eastward tilting of western uganda flow in the kafu river has been reversed and water draining from lake victoria has found a new course to the north where it flows over murchison falls and into lake albert the geologically recent derangement of these drainage systems is the result of uplift that is apparently continuing at the present time doornkamp and temple 1966 null figure 211 lake kyoga region uganda arrows show flow directions in rivers back tilting explains the shape of lake kyoga and lake kwania modified after doornkamp and temple 1966 elongated lakes the term elongated lakes is applied to lakes that are long and narrow these lakes are superimposed over basement structures in subsiding basins they are also closely related to active tectonics the puinahua 1324 km2 and punga 341 km2 lakes are both located in the south part of the maran basin figure 210 they are long and narrow and wider on the foothill side than on the craton side punga lake is superimposed over the structure of the santa elena uplift dumont and garcia 1991

1985 both lakes are also parallel to the strike of normal faulting with a nnwsse extension in the upland border dumont et al 1988 as a result the lakes are interpreted as the surface expression of tensional stress superimposed over reactivated basement structures due to the onset of andean tectonics dumont and garcia 1991 more precise morphological evidence of active tectonics comes from the punga lake according to testimony of old settlers and published travel journals stiglish 1904 the area was covered by forest that developed on a terrace before 1923 then the region began to subside the tree trunks of the drowned forest are still visible now below 2 m of water during low water stages in this very flat area the water level rises about 2 m during floods suggesting a minimum subsidence of 4 m over about 70 years a tectonic interpretation is favored because a local rise of base level cannot be involved only a downward motion of the area where the lake is observed can explain the phenomenon these lakes are related to downdropped blocks that are related to a tensional system terraces the vertical warping of terraces as a result of deformation has been studied by numerous investigators machida 1960 zuchiewicz 1980 king and stein 1983 the offset of terraces by lateral faulting gives a clear indication of fault movement the offset terraces at the mouth of the waiohine gorge in new zealand shows the amount of displacement and the episodic nature of the displacement figure 212 in addition to river terraces the deformation of lake terraces and marine terraces keller and pinter 1996 are proof of isostatic and tectonic activity because they formed horizontally at a given water level an example is the isostatic deformation of the pleistocene lake bonneville shorelines utah crittenden 1963 portions of the lake bonneville shorelines have been deformed as much as 210 feet as it drained and evaporated to form great salt lake in addition deformed marine terraces provide an excellent indication of recent deformation along 440 km of the pacific coast of baja california orme 1980 not only are terraces deformed but as an uplift is crossed a floodplain can be converted to a low terrace this will of course dramatically alter the hydraulics and hydrology of the reach in addition to the obvious evidence of deformation described above evidence of deformation is provided by alluvial deposits and paleosoils machette 1978 keller et al 1982 bull 1984 rockwell et al 1984 rockwell 1988 by variations in gradients of streams of different orders

fault shown on the diagram is about 08 km 12 mile modified after stevens 1974 river response the clearest evidence for tectonic effects on rivers are anomalous reaches that show dramatic changes of pattern trend and gradient that cannot be attributed to other causes structural geologists and petroleum geologists have known for years that rivers are strong indicators of faulting lattman 1959 howard 1967 tectonic activity can significantly control river patterns and behavior and this is especially true of alluvial rivers neef 1966 and radulescu 1962 state that neotectonic movements can be reflected only in those geomorphic features that react to the smallest changes of slope such as meander characteristics in addition the variations of thickness and distribution of recent sediments indicate the variability of tectonics in a given valley clearly one of the most sensitive indicators of change is the valley floor profile and longitudinal profile of a stream bendefy et al 1967 zuchiewicz 1979 alluvial rivers will be very sensitive indicators of valley slope change in order to maintain a constant gradient a river that is being steepened by a downstream tilt will increase its sinuosity or braid whereas a reduction of valley slope will lead to a reduction of sinuosity or aggradation if the pattern cannot change for example twidale 1966 reported that both the flinders and leichardt rivers have changed to a braided pattern as a result of the steepening of their gradient by the selwyn upwarp in northern queensland australia and the red river near winnipeg canada is straightening as a result of reduction of gradient by isostatic rebound welch 1973 other examples are provided by the mississippi river between st louis and cairo and the lower missouri river adams 1980 as well as the red river of the north near winnipeg canada vanicek and nagy 1980 baselevel changes can also resemble the effects of active tectonics and can provide information on channel change for example if sealevel is lowered and a steep portion of the continental shelf is exposed the effect will be like that downstream of the axis of an uplift lane 1955 argued that a lowering of baselevel will cause channel adjustment throughout most of the river indeed lanes 1955 argument that a stream will restore its gradient at a higher or lower level following a baselevel change is conceptually correct because if the river is initially at grade then to move its sediment load and water discharge through the channel the original gradient of the stream must be reestablished however sediment loads may be greater after channel incision and less after aggradation another fallacy in lanes argument is the assumption that the valley slope and channel gradient are identical this is not the case and the twodimensional perspective leads to erroneous conclusions for example a sinuous river has a gradient less than that of the valley floor sinuosity p is the ratio between channel length l c and valley length l v and it is also the ratio between valley slope s v and channel gradient s c as follows therefore a straight channel has a sinuosity of 10 and the gradient of the channel and the slope of the valley floor are the same it has been demonstrated that rivers can respond to major changes of water and sediment load primarily by pattern changes schumm 1968 and that much of the pattern variability of large alluvial rivers such as the mississippi indus and nile reflect the variability of the valley slope schumm et al 1994 jorgensen et al 1993 schumm and galay 1994 null figure 213 effect of a baselevel fall on channel length and pattern see text for discussion figure 213 illustrates this concept geometrically and it shows the impact of the lowering of baselevel in a valley with a stream of sinuosity p 15 the line ac represents the channel profile and the line ab represents the profile of the valley floor points b and c are at the river mouth and points f and g are at the same location in the valley the channel distance is onethird longer than the valley distance and the difference in channel and valley slope reflects the sinuosity of the stream the length of the channel is 15 times the length of the valley and therefore the stream gradient is onethird less than the valley slope equation 1 if a vertical fall of baselevel from b to d and c to e is assumed channel incision and lateral erosion will steepen the valley floor if the channel is not confined laterally it can adjust to the increased valley slope fd by increasing sinuosity to 20 and the channel profile is extended to h in this case incision ceases at point f in the valley and at point g in the channel because the increase of sinuosity from 15 to 20 from g to h maintains a constant channel gradient over the reach of increased valley slope fd the onethird increase of channel length sinuosity between g and h compensates for a onethird steepening of the valley floor from f to d according to lanes assumptions the effect of this baselevel fall would be propagated upstream to point a where an amount of erosion equal to bd would occur however because the stream can adjust the steepening of the valley floor will not result in a change of stream gradient rather the channel lengthens and the effect of baselevel lowering is propagated only a relatively short distance upstream the distance will undoubtedly depend on local conditions and the original slope of the valley floor but this exercise supports sauciers 1991 contention that pleistocene sea level change in the lower mississippi valley was effective only as far as baton rouge see also blum 1993 and blum and valastro 1994 the probability that a large river can adjust in this fashion is made more likely by the fact that the baselevel changes in nature will take place relatively slowly and not abruptly unlike during the experimental studies the river therefore has more time to adjust by changing sinuosity further evidence for the type of channel response shown in figure 213 is demonstrated by the experimental studies of jeff ware 1992 oral comm he lowered baselevel relatively slowly to a maximum of 12 cm in a flume with a total length of 184 m this change would have doubled the channel gradient however the effect of the baselevel lowering extended only 4 m upstream and the change in baselevel was accommodated by an increase of sinuosity from 12 to 15 in the lower 4 m in the flume it is clear however that pattern change did not totally compensate for the change of baselevel this channel widened and roughness increased thereby assuming part of the adjustment to the baselevel change wares experiments showed that a sinuosity increase which resulted in a slope decrease was only part of the adjustment and width depth and roughness adjusted to decrease velocity and stream power therefore channel pattern change may only absorb part of a valley slope or baselevel change the river nile provides an example of such shared adjustment with both sinuosity and width changing as valley slope changes schumm and galay 1994 changes of valleyfloor gradient provide an explanation of downstream pattern variations but variations of valleyfloor slope can be the result of several influences tectonic activity may change the slope of the valley floor and have its effect on the channel pattern adams 1980 in addition a highsedimenttransporting tributary may build a fanlike deposit in the valley which will persist even after the tributary sediment load has decreased when the main river crosses this fan pattern changes will result as the river attempts to maintain a constant gradient tributaries to the jordan river in israel have developed fanlike deposits in the valley and the valley floor of the jordan valley undulates as a result the jordan river as it approaches one of these convexities straightens as it crosses the upstream flatter part of the fan and then it develops a more sinuous course on the steeper downstream side of the fan schumm 1977 p 140 it is important to realize that channels that lie near a pattern threshold figure 23 may change their characteristics dramatically with only a slight change in the controlling variable for example some rivers that are meandering and that are near pattern thresholds become braided with only a small addition of bed load schumm 1979 experimental studies and field observations confirm that a change of valleyfloor slope will cause a change of channel morphology the change will differ however depending where the channel lies on a plot such as that of figure 23 and depending on the type of channel figure 24 for example with increasing slope a straight channel will become sinuous a low sinuosity channel will become more sinuous and a meandering channel will braid with decreasing slope a braided channel will meander and a meandering channel will straighten null figure 214 reaches of degradation and aggradation associated with uplift and faulting although pattern changes may dominate river response deposition in reaches of reduced gradient is likely as is channel incision and bank erosion in reaches of steepened gradient figure 214 in fact upstream deposition will reduce downstream sediment loads thereby increasing the tendency for downstream erosion therefore in addition to the primary valleyfloor deformation by active tectonics and the secondary channel response to this deformation there are thirdorder effects beyond the area of deformation for example deposition upstream from the axis of a dome can progress further upstream by backfilling beyond the area of active deformation figure 214 this means that the uplift is acting as a dam and unless erosion on the steeper downstream side of the uplift produces sufficient sediment to compensate erosion will occur downstream beyond the limits of deformation however it is more likely that reduced sediment load will accelerate erosion on the steeper downstream reach and when this increased load moves downstream aggradation will result figure 214 null figure 215 effect of change from weaker w to more resistant r materials on meander pattern another aspect of both active and neotectonics is the appearance of more resistant materials in the channel as the channel degrades resistant alluvium clay plugs gravel armor or bedrock will confine the channel and retard meander shift and bank erosion the result should be deformed or compressed meanders upstream and a change of meander character at the contact for example as meanders shift downvalley their movement may be retarded if more resistant alluvium or bedrock is encountered jin and schumm 1987 hence a fault may present a barrier with the result that upstream meanders are compressed and deformed figure 215 a similar pattern will result if the river encounters bedrock as it crosses an upwarp or if as a result of incision it encounters resistant materials in a portion of its course yeromenko and ivanov 1977 reviewed the russian literature and concluded that for rivers crossing uplifts the largest number of meanders occur upstream of the structures which supports gardners 1975 observations of bedrock channels in the colorado plateau this is the reverse of what is expected for alluvial channels from the relation of figure 23 therefore an investigator must not simply base conclusions on river pattern alone discussion alluvium is usually assumed to hide the underlying geology but rates of active tectonic movement are sufficiently rapid to affect the morphology and behavior of alluvial rivers rivers being the most sensitive components of the landscape will provide evidence of even slow aseismic tectonic activity for example evidence of active tectonics is as follows 1 deformation of valley floor longitudinal profile 2 deformation of channel longitudinal profile 3 change of channel pattern 4 change of channel width and depth 5 conversion of floodplain to a low terrace 6 reaches of active channel incision or lateral shift 7 effects both upstream and downstream of the zone of deformation degradation aggradation flooding bank erosion 8 formation of lakes alluvial channels are sensitive indicators of change but they also adjust to changes of hydrology and sediment load as well as to active tectonics therefore it may be difficult to determine the cause of channel change when in fact human activities have been changing both discharge and sediment load during historic time pattern change alone is not sufficient evidence for active tectonics rather it is one bit of evidence that must be supported with other morphologic evidence andor surveys that provide clear evidence of deformation in many areas the evidence will be circumstantial nevertheless anomalous reaches that are not related to artificial controls tributary influences lithologic change or paleotectonics may reasonably be assumed to be the result of active tectonics until proved otherwise lakes can also provide information on subsidence and ria lakes can be evidence of tilting or even hydrologic and climatic influences for example during pleistocene aggradation in the ohio river and mississippi river valleys numerous lakes formed in tributary valleys therefore care must be exercised when determining the tectonic significance of lakes and other river anomalies 
 7 the future of boundaryless careers when massive economic restructuring forced william h whyte jrs 1956 organization man to walk permanently out of the front doors of the corporation many of the assumptions of a traditional career path followed shortly behind in the wake of his departure people were left pondering how they would survive without a job for life a corporate road map to guide their destiny and the firms hierarchy to define their status or place in society without employers orderly structures external guides for action and linear career paths however just what is the future of career when the career devolves to the level of the individual does free agency prevail and a form of career anarchy result is there anything that can be concluded about careers if everyone seems to be doing their own thing we argue here that the answer is an emphatic yes the new environment suggests a shift from preordained and linear development to perpetually changing career paths and possibilities as a result a shift from bounded careers prescribed by relatively stable organisational and occupational structures to boundaryless careers where uncertainty and flexibility are the order of the day is increasingly common the concept of the boundaryless career is broadly based and intended to reflect the emergent pace of economic change it does not characterise any single career form but rather a range of possible forms that defy traditional employment assumptions arthur rousseau 1996 p 6 the myriad interactions of a boundaryless career over a lifetime of work experiences can appear overwhelming a complex web of relationships emerges from numerous exchanges among individuals teams and employers the interplay may seem downright chaotic so much so that one may be tempted to think that no aggregates can be drawn from this seemingly random microlevel behaviour yet despite the large amount of publicity generated as organization man was shown to the door a large proportion of people who participate in the work place and even whole industries never really played by the traditional rules anyway for these people and industries the boundaryless career is simply business as usual it is business to which we can turn to understand better the future of career or as we see the future the boundaryless career we focus in this chapter on situations where boundaryless career practices appear to be well established and fruitful involving industries where open labour markets have thrived our examination suggests that seemingly random microlevel activities result in the creation of emergent pattern and order further examination reveals not only order but remarkable stability in the absence of external guides people selforganise to learn and make sense of their environments moreover the resulting social interdependence provides a new form of cohesiveness that in turn introduces new structure microlevel activities gather the force and the power to shape macrolevel processes and larger institutions it is organising rather than organisation that is the catchword of the boundaryless career in this chapter we set out to explore the pervasive nature of boundaryless careers we present a theoretical perspective through which we can understand the dynamics of boundaryless careers followed by descriptive analysis demonstrating evidence of theory in practice in two selected industries first we present relevant aspects of karl weicks work 1979 1995 and 1996 and discuss the process of enactment we then examine the industry cases we conclude by refining the arguments by noting key behavioural aspects of enactment and other considerations of the process an enactment perspective our exploration in this chapter is framed in the socialpsychological perspective of karl weick 1996 weicks work provides a theoretical lens for explaining the processes at work in boundaryless career behaviour his conception of enactment directly related to his previous 1995 work on sensemaking explains the dynamics of the characteristic interdependence that operates in boundaryless careers the enactment view emphasises that action creates the environment that is people create situations and understandings out of their own dispositions and backgrounds a simple analogy is with the legal system people enact laws which become part of the legal system which in turn influences further behaviour leading people to enact new laws and so on a legal system continually evolves from the enactment of individual laws similarly career systems evolve from the enactment of individual careers another way to engage with enactment is to relate it to the process of natural selection according to weick 1996 careers unfold through successive cycles of enactment selection and retention whereby the enactment of careers gives rise to broader organising of work arrangements from this standpoint the basic theme for the entire organizing model is found in the following recipe for sensemaking how can i know what i think until i see what i say weick 1979 p 133 in the simplest form of the recipe enactment is saying action selection is seeing what i say perception and retention is knowing what i think sensemaking if enactment is saying then it is in essence the action of individuals in their environment that starts the process when someone takes action or interacts with their environment it immediately impacts others and hence the individual produces part of their environment for example if you believe a certain group of individuals to be hostile when you interact with them your behaviour may reflect your fear in response they may sense that fear and behave in a hostile manner the environment becomes hostile moreover you have contributed to enacting that hostile environment the result is a circular selfreinforcing relationship resembling a selffulfilling prophecy an alternative perhaps more satisfactory circular relationship could result if instead of fear you initially showed confidence how do we relate this process to boundaryless careers for this it is important to understand that there is less room for personal inputs manoeuvring or enactment if there are clear salient rules and structures defining behaviour in traditional bounded organisations and careers the proliferation of structure hierarchy plans detailed job descriptions prescribed relationships and established road maps provide an armoury of articulated rules and social cues to guide behaviour the situation is strong mischel 1968 in as much as it provides little scope for improvisation in the pure form of the boundaryless career however such explicit guides do not exist instead of providing clear guidelines employment situations are characterised by ambiguity weak situations fall short of providing sufficient incentives for consistent behaviour or even similar expectations for those operating within them mischel 1968 in weak situations individuals are not able to interpret events in the same way and the resulting ambiguity opens the door to myriad personal interpretations and opportunities for enactment people engage in a stable process of trial and error that resembles an evolutionary system weick 1979 people join together in shared improvisation that begins to form new codes and structures to guide their further behaviour in the process microstrength shapes macroweaknesses weick 1996 p 44 through the unfolding of boundaryless careers to illustrate the preceding argument we will apply weicks ideas to descriptions provided by annalee saxenian 1996 on the dynamics of the silicon valley and by candace jones 1996 on the independent film industry we reinterpret the contributions of these authors by explicitly reframing them within weicks framework and we emphasise it is these three authors and their original descriptions and ideas that deserve the major part of the credit for this chapter to show how enactment and associated principles of selforganising and learning come to life we will trace the process of enactment in each setting first we will describe the factors that have contributed to boundaryless career forms in each example next we will cite some of the characteristics that make the resulting circumstances weak after that we will discuss the social behaviour and collective actions that fill the resulting void in the environment finally we will point out the patterns order and shape we see enactment bringing to each of these respective settings by doing so we hope to convey the pervasive qualities of both the process of enactment and the vehicle through which it operates the boundaryless career the silicon valley the silicon valley is notorious for the individual and collective success of its firms so much so that the name silicon valley has come to be synonymous with the electronics industry the region is regarded as the centre for excellence and innovation and has given rise to some of the worlds most influential firms including apple hewlett packard and intel since its inception the valley has operated with an individualistic open labour market today the learning advantages that emanate from associated boundaryless career behaviour are regarded as a key source of competitive advantage for the region saxenian 1996 one can argue that the valleys boundarylessness is a necessary feature of operating in a dynamic industry that demands constant innovation proponents point out that in order to learn and solve the problems encountered in rapid technological advancement knowledge must be shared among firms in a symbiotic balance between cooperation and competition boundaryless characteristics appear more prominently when an industry is knowledge rather than capitalintensive or when firms operate in economic clusters however other industry clusters and several notable large electronics firms do not engage with boundaryless practices we may therefore attribute the boundaryless features of the silicon valley to its heritage some believe this is in part due to the location of the region hosting a west coast northern californian alternative in geographical isolation from the established east coast industry the greenfield site had an empty slate and no institutional rules others like the late william hewlett a key and highly influential founder of the region believe that success stemmed from the learning advantages of an open labour market hewlett routinely offered the following advice if you want to succeed here you need to be willing to do three things change jobs often talk to your competitors and take risks even if it means failing saxenian 1996 p 23 hewlett was himself influenced by his stanford dean of engineering william terman a mentor and an influential hewlett packard board member collins porras 1995 today hewletts and termans philosophy permeates the region despite fierce interfirm competition open information exchange is common practice among the regions producers several features of the valley contribute to creating a weak environment the high pace of technology and product life cycles fluidity of firm formation and failure rapid employee turnover resulting in little companyspecific socialisation as well as a lack of meaningful institutionally based hierarchy all contribute to an environment in which individuals rely on alternative cues to guide their behaviour for example in the valley technology moves quickly and competition is tough new firms form almost overnight and many disappear just as quickly when firms come and go like ships in the night it is not surprising that employees tend to identify with their profession not their company moreover peoples loyalty is not only to their profession but to the host industry region as one local semiconductor executive reportedly noted many of us wake up in the morning thinking that we work for silicon valley inc saxenian 1996 p 23 they view jobchanging as the norm average job tenure is in the area of two years and annual turnover is around 35 and often higher for smaller firms saxenian 1996 as one engineer explained two or three years is about the max at a job for the valley because theres always something more interesting across the street saxenian p 28 knowledge and practices cross company borders at a pace that defies the embedding of routines within the boundaries of any single company and instead favours intercompany exchange everyone knows that upon leaving a company they may well work together again in the future a colleague might become a customer or a competitor todays boss could be tomorrows subordinate saxenian p 29 institutionally based hierarchy therefore loses its saliency in the valley respect and authority are gained through competence technical excellence and market share with the highest regard accorded to successful entrepreneurs in the context of this weak environment clear social behaviour emerges as structure gets built at the microlevel people seek to form relationships and routines in order to learn and thrive in their surroundings in the valley information is the lifeblood of the industry and continuous learning through relationships is the key to a successful career people build their own competence by active membership in the larger learning community learning takes place in the pub or club in the valleys early days it used to take place in the infamous wagon wheel bar and the homebrew computer club now it takes place in one of many watering holes or hobby groups where the valleys hightechnology workers regularly meet for lunch or after work in these meeting places people gather to see old friends gossip and make new acquaintances in the workers adopted social settings the transition from friendly chatter to serious business occurs naturally in the silicon valley collective actions unfold through a combination of mutual interests intellectual curiosity and problem solving geared towards developing new markets technologies products or applications for computers workers have a systemic commitment to technical excellence in their field as one engineer explained the process is quite simple people rub shoulders and share ideas saxenian p 27 the knowledge of these informal groups is so powerful that many local entrepreneurs came to see social relationships and even gossip as crucial aspects of their business saxenian p 26 as one local manager claimed over a lunch conversation or a beer youll learn that company a or company b has a technology you want if it fits your needs youll build it into your next product saxenian p 31 in this manner microlevel conversations influence the creation of new technologies products and applications it is through such social interaction and collective action that we begin to understand how patterns and order emerge in the valley in the absence of hierarchy and centralised planning employees in the valley rely on their skills rather than on formal position to provide a reference point for their careers such selfgenerated guides are reinforced by professional social networks which provide a tacit road map about who knows who and who does what in the industry these networks serve as efficient job search networks and makeshift recruitment centres as one engineer reported you dont just hire people out of the blue in general its people you know or you know someone who knows them saxenian p 27 social networks impose structure on larger and looser situations it is the region and its relationships rather than the firm that define opportunities for individual and collective advances in silicon valley saxenian 1996 thus while silicon valleys high rates of job mobility and newfirm formation lead to local losses for individual firms they also foster a dynamic process of adaptation that spurs the evolution of the region knowledge of the latest techniques in design production and marketing is diffused rapidly throughout the area the result is an exceptional rate of technical and organisational innovation created by a complex mix of social solidarity and individualistic competition saxenian 1996 p 25 the resilience of silicon valleys economy shows that an unpredictable open labour market and seemingly chaotic career paths and relationships have led to macroeconomic stability for the region and hence continued opportunity for the community at large ironically many of these silicon valley job hoppers may well have led more stable lives than the upwardly mobile organizational men of the 1950s who were transferred from place to place by the same employer saxenian p 28 the independent filmmaking industry like the silicon valley the independent filmmaking industry is noted for its innovative ability cutting edge creativity and overall economic success like in the silicon valley boundaryless careers are central to independent filmmaking activities these activities evolved in the wake of fierce competition posed by the proliferation of television and the need to cut fixed costs they superseded the former studiobased model of inhouse film production and its associated restrictive practices since the early 1970s the new model has persisted boundaryless careers provide the building blocks that combine to facilitate production of the industrys separately creative parts independent film production has thrived as a superior organising model to its inhouse predecessor jones 1996 several characteristics of the independent film industry favour boundarylessness including the uncertainty in the marketplace the limited project duration the lack of vertical integration among industry players and the excess supply of quality labour the uncertainty of the market stems from the fact that production of any particular film revolves around whether or not sufficient financing is obtained to start and ultimately complete production of any given film when financing is arranged it is specifically for the purpose of completing a single project the making of the film the limited duration of the project is such that all resources including human resources are temporary the assembled company is essentially wound down upon the films release at this time the films credits symbolise that those who made it have moved on to other assignments uncertainty over financing and limited project duration foster a weak environment in which permanent structure is dysfunctional studios combine with subcontractors for specific film projects and disband when the work is done moreover the projectbased system allows for highly complex unique products films to benefit from rapid and efficient allocation and reallocation of resources each time a film is completed the whole process starts over again and employment relationships are renegotiated a ready supply of quality labour contributes to the success of the independent production model the industry is a magnet for talented committed workers eager for work on the industrys terms these include being ready to depart to remote locations at a moments notice however as with silicon valley hightechnology projects much of the work is economically clustered thereby facilitating fluidity of movement from one challenge to another as joness 1996 research affirms peoples social behaviour reveals that several distinct stages can be observed over the course of a career in the film industry at the beginning stage freelance employees are constantly vying to participate in an industry in which there are no clear rules for entry as one gripelectrician explained theres no tried and true way to get started you have to find people you like who make movies its getting the first job that is the hardest jones 1996 p 62 once inside the worker at the crafting stage finds that you build your reputation every day youre only as good as your last job pp 645 reputation matters as careers are selfmanaged and advanced through successive credits that span multiple largely forgotten temporary filmmaking companies having learned key skills and become indoctrinated into the industry culture individuals enter a navigating stage furthering their reputation and developing the personal contacts that provide the resources to navigate from one project to another in the words of one film commissioner we are a big industry but a small industry because we talk to one another jones 1996 p 65 it is through talking to each other that people gain access to experiences that both hone existing abilities and cultivate more complex skills eventually successful careers go full circle and move to a maintenance stage here senior members of the industry identify and train new members establish workshops that develop talent in the field and coordinate events such as film festivals during this period people address personal needs which may have been neglected during earlier career stages because of the necessity to survive in a relatively unforgiving industry in a weak environment that lasts a lifetime it is critical that nonbureaucratic forms of cohesion bring order to the industry part of this cohesion is provided by subcontractors whose processes of selection training and socialisation bring boundaryless careers together in projectbased arrangements that provide tacit infrastructure and social familiarity however it is at the level of the individual career that we can most clearly see the microlevel behaviour that fills the relatively structureless context despite the fact that no explicit rules or operating procedures exist there is much tacit communication that binds professionals together the aggregate effects of individuals acting independently leads to macrolevel cohesion shared understanding and related expectations for example regarding the need for unusual working hours and the use of idle time to teach newcomers professional skills play a key role linking identities to workplace interactions in the process of learning the ropes individuals are socialised and begin to make key contacts that help progress them to the next stages of their career once socialised people engage in collective learning as they problemsolve on a projectbyproject basis learning accumulates disperses and evolves as industry specialists enact their working environment from microlevel enactment we see macrolevel influence and patterns order and shape in the independent film industry not only do we observe distinct stages of careers we see aggregate social norms influencing behaviour what one can see from the pattern of progression that characterises freelance boundaryless careers in the film industry is that although few formal boundaries exist persistent social structures and repeated patterns of interaction can be observed in the process of enacting their careers individuals engage in reinforcing the cohesive social patterns of the industry which serve to guide the stages of their development in this respect careers in the silicon valley and the film industry have much in common with organising in filmmaking resembling a projectbased valley just as careers can be traced in the valley through the development of technology and tightly knit project teams in film a clear pattern also emerges that reveals microlevel organising shaping macro activity refinements on enactment agency and communion both of our previous examples suggest that the enactment of boundaryless careers unfolds through a mixture of personal initiative and mutual cooperation marshall 1989 after bakan 1966 refers to the elements in this mixture as agency and communion at a very basic level agency is about control and communion is about cooperation agency is individualistic and characterised by autonomy independence initiative and adaptation it is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people are ultimately responsible for their own development communion in contrast to agency is concerned about connections relationships tolerance and trust it is fundamental to boundaryless careers in that people need to manage their own arrangements for working with others1 in weak environments in which rules are not defined and behavioural responses not controlled both agency and communion are means by which people respond to uncertainty agency provides direction and drive to career behaviour and helps to diffuse ambiguity by providing vision and longterm goals left to its own means however agency may cause strong hierarchies to reform the balance of power to be lost and most importantly the trust and cooperation necessary for people and information to move across boundaries to be forfeited communion provides the platform for mutual support and collective learning through which shared visions may be pursued however unbridled communion may neglect to attend to the mechanisms and rewards through which effective collaboration can occur the silicon valley and independent filmmaking examples illustrate the interplay of agency and communion agency occurs through the individual initiative and enthusiasm people bring to their careers within their adopted industries communion occurs through the collaborative ways of working that substitute for more formal arrangements together the combination of behaviours supports current hightechnology or filmmaking projects while it simultaneously develops people for further opportunities this development includes communitybuilding that will influence the makeup and effectiveness of future project teams host industries will thrive our examples suggest as long as agency and communion are allowed to work in tandem rousseau arthur 1999 contemporary views of work frequently lament a loss of community in restructured employment arrangements however in calling for a return to community these views frequently look no further than the single company an enactment perspective suggests that communities can be much more broadly diffused both the silicon valley and filmmaking stories demonstrate that host industries as well as their embedded occupations provide alternative contexts for communitybuilding to occur other kinds of community stemming for example from shared ideological family educational ethnic or gender attachments can also provide enduring support for peoples boundaryless career endeavours parker arthur 2000 1some researchers notably marshall 1989 emphasise the feminine characteristics of communion versus the masculine characteristics of agency we do not do so here although it may be interesting to contemplate whether the silicon valley is in the broadest sense feminised reciprocity a related concept is that of reciprocity since workers cannot be all things to all people all of the time a balance of behaviours is required reciprocity refers to the connection between what people give to and what people take from their employment situations traditional career models used to prescribe that people offer loyalty in return for deferred rewards accordingly deferred pension rights vacation time promotion opportunities and social acceptance were most reserved for those who had served their time in contrast those who changed employer were handicapped by the loss of the privileges that they left behind the silicon valley and filmmaking worlds suggest a different logic one where the old entitlementbased models are a hindrance to boundaryless career investments with boundaryless careers employment relationships are too fluid to assume the trappings of traditional loyaltybased employment systems in the simplest case employment arrangements reflect a spot contract involving a simple exchange of work for immediate financial payment however our examples suggest subtler forces are at work people are recruited to participate in hightechnology and filmmaking projects for the skills that they bring skills that have been developed from previous projects the system at its best consists of cycles in which the learning taken from previous projects is applied in the current project which in turn provides new learning opportunities the simple exchange of commitment to do ones best in return for learning opportunities may be a common one in contemporary employment and one that inspires many workers to seek new employment pastures when their learning slows down arthur inkson pringle 1999 the concept of reciprocity reinforces the significance of projectbased activities work which provides an underlying projectbased structure such as in construction jobs law cases or computing programmes provides a particular time span for reciprocities to occur if the benefits are genuinely mutual projects provide a basis for high commitment from both parties to the shortterm employment contract yet the benefits of reciprocity can accrue beyond the projects conclusion individuals can take their learning from projects and project participants with them meanwhile their influence on other project participants can be retained in the sponsoring company or the host industry or both ultimately other industries can also benefit as mobile workers transport best practices to new situations a new continuity what general lessons can be claimed from our two examples many would argue that traditional employment systems going back to the factories of the eighteenth century do not favour boundaryless careers we agree but we also live in a time when those systems are failing and where their underlying assumptions of stasis are incompatible with the emergent reality of persistent change moreover those systems were designed according to a conception of labour capital rather than to one of intellectual capital yet it is the conception of intellectual capital that is increasingly emphasised today readers of this chapter will most likely see themselves as having a capacity for continuous learning is it really too great a step to extend the same belief in the capacity for learning to the workforce at large if the workforce at large can learn what are the social arrangements that best sustain new learning leaving the determination of what is to be learned to a few senior managers knowing what is best for people or trusting that they might know or at least contribute to knowing what is best for themselves having people trapped by deferred rewards williamson 1975 or acknowledging that those rewards systems are grounded in distrust a colleague recently visited the czech republic and explored that countrys relatively rapid adjustment to a market economy she asked what was the single best thing a czech worker could do to learn the underlying principles of the market work for mcdonalds went the surprising reply but only for six months it was explained that six months was quite long enough for the uninitiated worker to appreciate the importance of customers and customer service after six months the worker had learned what he or she could and it was time from a career perspective to move on the contrast between working for mcdonalds for six months or working for mcdonalds for a lifetime is writ large the contrast between boundaryless careers and their traditional bounded counterparts todays work is increasingly intelligent work quinn 1992 that calls on workers learning capacities and as our examples suggest provides an organising structure rich in project opportunities through which learning episodes can unfold if that organising structure is lacking the worker can heed the advice of our czech informant and design a project for herself or himself in the future we submit most careers will be boundaryless we have sought to illustrate the future by exploring two industries where boundaryless careers have flourished reaping benefits for people companies and host industries alike new theories such as karl weicks theory on the enactment of careers can help us to understand the underlying patterns and dynamics inherent in complex selforganising social phenomena people may not need to move between firms perpetually but they will need to take charge of their own learning agendas as they take charge boundaries will form and reform and underlying order provide a macroeconomic stability in

 a physics of semantics each of the chapters of investigations broaches new territory each is tentative and incomplete pointing but not fully adequate yet i persistently hope it is better to light one candle againstwhat the darkness the veil beyond which we have had no framework of questions before there are grounds reasoned about by the best of philosophers and scientists of the past several centuries to doubt a physics of semantics we are on shaky ground yet when the first hard frost comes when the birches have been swung their crimson leaves scattered carelessly when crystals splint shallow ponds and old egrets stand dark watch the coming dawn longlegged knowing how winter is thin when the first phase transition of water to ice forms slight solidity across meadow streams small creatures of flesh and concept tiptoe gingerly to some far side where perhaps something new is to be found we have lacked a physical definition of an autonomous agent able to manipulate the universe on its own behalfthe egret whose foreboding of winter leads to lifted wing and steady powerful flight the egret is as much a part of physical reality as the atom and perhaps more than the vaunted quark but autonomous agents we who do daily manipulate the world on our own behalf we to whom intentionality and purpose are so inevitably attributed by our common languages we are by my definition of autonomous agents also nothing but physical systems with a peculiar organization of processes and properties if the concept of autonomous agents were something like a usefulor more a properdefinition of life itself then autonomous agents span the gap from the merely physical to that new realm of the merely physical where purpose is ascribed by all of us to one another semantics enters with purpose for this to be true it is not necessary that the carriers of purpose say the same bacterium heading upstream in the glucose gradient be conscious i hope my definition of an autonomous agent is useful an autocatalytic system carrying out a work cycle now rather broadened by the realization that autonomous agents also do often detect and measure and record displacements of external systems from equilibrium that can be used to extract work then do extract work propagating work and constraint construction from their environment knowhow bring ourselves empathetically and objectively back three billion years to the mixed microbial community flourishing right about where most of us are now plus or minus a modicum of layers of surface crustal material i want to say that the autonomous agents comprising that community had individually and collectively the embodied knowhow to get on with making a living in the natural games that constituted their world indeed as i have emphasized before a biosphere is a selfconsistent coconstruction of autonomous agents ways of making a living and the search procedures mutation recombination as well as behavioral search open to autonomous agents those means of making a living that were well searched out and mastered by the agents and their search procedures became the kinds of jobs that were widely filled the abundant niches of the biosphere there is in this whole selfconstructing system a wider knowhow beyond the knowhow of any single autonomous agent spinning eagerly in its microenvironment yet clearly the knowhow is distributed there is no autonomous agent no one who knows how the whole system works any more than anyone at present knows how the global economic system works in its myriad interactions deals steals hopes and frustrations what in the world is knowhow philosophers distinguish between knowhow and know that i know how to tie my shoes and am learning how to play jazz drums know that concerns propositions most conveniently human propositions i know that the moon isthey tell menot made of green cheese i know that the earth circles the sun that the earth is roughly spherical that chairs are used to sit on know that brings with it the standard and nonstandard issues of the truth or falseness of propositions as they report states of the world perhaps higher primates who are trained to manipulate simple symbols with apparent reference to the world also can know that with respect to propositions unlike know that knowhow does not involve propositions about the world knowhow involves procedural knowledge about how to get on in the world the cheetah streaking after the wildebeest the athletic genius high jumping have the knowhow to do it does a bacterium know how to make a living in its world i certainly want to say yes without attributing consciousness in any way watch the myriad subtle turnings on and o of genes metabolic switching mechanical twitching sensing of glucose gradient swimming and tumbling upstream to higher glucose concentrations it knows how all right even if it cannot talk about how it gets on with its business but then try to talk about tying your shoes or the skilled driving when you become aware some dozens of miles down the road that you have accomplished the tasks without paying the slightest focused attention thank god for knowhow know that is a thin veneer on a fourbillionyearold knowhow skill abundant in the biosphere but any autonomous agent proliferating alone or in a congery of other agents it would seem is also graced by the selfsame knowhow if we synthesize autonomous agents in the next decades and they coevolve under our rapt gaze over months or years into a modestly complex ecosystem brimming with novel life forms they too will know how to make a living in their mutually created world plus the boundary conditions we more or less intelligently impose on them the knowhow is in these terms nothing but another view of the propagating closures of catalysis work tasks sensing recording and acting that we now recognize as inherent in the doings of autonomous agents the knowhow is not outside that propagating organization the knowhow is the propagating organization semantics all of which brings us inevitably to the brink of semantics it is simple at its roots you see an incoming molecular species arriving in the interior of an autonomous agent really is i food ii poison iii a signal iv neutral v something else once there is an autonomous agent there is a semantics from its privileged point of view the incoming molecule is yuck or yum i think the major conceptual step to yuck or yum is unavoidable once there is an autonomous agent and i think we have roughly the darwinian criteria in mind if yum then there will probably be more of this type of agent osprings of the first if yuck it is not so likely this lineage will prosper once yuck and yum we are not far from c s pierces meaningladen semiotic triad sign signified significans like it or not the glucose gradient is a sign a predictor of more glucose that way granted the glucose is not an arbitrary symbol any more than a cloud is an arbitrary symbol of rain in this restricted sense signs are causally correlated with that which is signified by contrast the relation between the word chair and that which it signifies and on which i am now sitting is arbitrary but can chemical signals in bacterial and plant and human communities be arbitrary from a chemical causal point of view if so can mere chemicals be signs in the full piercean sense i believe it is clear that mere chemistry in an autonomous agent can harbor symbols and signs in the full senses of the words consider first the famous genetic code triplets of nucleotides in an rna molecule stand for specific amino acids that will end up incorporated into a protein the detailed causal machinery involves transfer rna molecules with their anticodon site and the distant site to which amino acids are attached the aminoacyle transferase enzymes that charge the amino acid binding site of each transfer rna with the proper amino acid among the twenty amino acids the binding of the charged transfer rnas anticodon site to the proper rna code word triplet the ribosome that glides between adjacent charged transfer rna molecules and links the successive amino acids into the growing polypeptide chain that hangs free in the cytoplasm tethered by the ribosome to the messenger rna molecule as it is translated the arbitrariness of the genetic code is exemplified by the evolution of novel transfer rna molecules which translate a given messenger rna code word triplet into a dierent amino acid as j monod properly emphasized three decades ago in a slightly dierent context concerning activation and inhibition of enzymes at allosteric sites on the enzyme that are distant from the catalytic site the relation of chemical structures that achieve control of catalysis are utterly arbitrary with respect to the chemical structures that undergo the catalysis the same is true of the transfer rna where the anticodon site is distant from the amino acid binding site because of this which amino acid is charged onto a particular transfer rna is utterly arbitrary and controlled by the aminoacyle transferase enzyme that does the charging plus the structure of the amino acid binding site on the transfer rna both of these can be altered without altering the anticodoncodon matching mechanism in short chemistry allows arbitrary organizations of control relations it seems fully legitimate to assign the concepts of sign signified and significans to the genetic code it seems legitimate to extend that notion to much of the subtle signaling chemical and otherwise within and between autonomous agents as exemplified by plants that upon infestation by a particular insect secrete a secondary metabolite chemical that warns other members of the same species that an insect infestation is happening and to turn on defensive antiinsect secondary metabolites the calculus that is claude shannons elegant information theory has always been about reduction of uncertainty about the statistics of the source of a set of symbols nowhere in the core of shannons work concerning the encoding and transmission of information does the meaning or semantics of the information enter this is no criticism and is widely known and appreciated there is however just a hint of semantics in shannons view that the semantics resides in the decoder i cannot buy shannons view unless the decoder is an autonomous agent if not then the decoder merely transforms a bit string sent along a communication channel into some other discrete or continuous dynamicsperhaps a set of waterfilled bowls is drained by turning on a machine that opens valves between the bowls and to the outside world in particular ways the patterns of bowl drainage upon receipt of the binary string messages sent along the communication channel constitutes the decoding but if the recipient is an autonomous agent such as a bacterium and the incoming molecule is a symbolsign of a paramecium or an amoeba on the roam and the bacterium swims away and avoids becoming dinner that sequence of events seems laden with semantics if only the bacterium could tell us did you see that truck of a paramecium coming at me ive run into that one before i ducked under a boulder and he never sensed me i made it home pass me some more glucose please martha i will return in the next chapter to discuss such stories for i will say that we cannot prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and therefore cannot deduce that which will unfold thus among other things we must tell stories to understand the oriented actions of agents in their worlds do not be overly quick to accuse me of anthropomorphizing i too know the risks including the common claim that we can always in principle translate from intentional talk to the fully predictive causal account of the events in question but patience not only are we unable to prestate the configuration space of a biosphere and predict what will unfold but we also cannot even translatein the sense of necessary and sucient conditionsfrom legal talk to normal intentional talk let alone from legal talk of henderson found guilty of murder to a physical talk about soundwave forms monitored and masses at spacetime lines as a description then lets just be naive for the moment the semantics of the yuck or yum coming into a simple autonomous agentsay an early bacteriumis somehow linked with the embodied knowhow of that agent in making a living or failing to make a living in its world the semantics of an event is some subset of the fully embroidered contextdependent set of causal implications of the event or signal in question for want of a nail the shoe was lost for want of the shoe the horse was lost and for want of the horse the rider was lost more or less said benjamin franklin the semantics of the nail is some subset of this embroidered contextdependent set of implications of the event or signal in question to the autonomous agents in the coevolving system it seems hard to ascribe purpose in the sense of acting on its own behalf to a stone or a chair and easy with respect to an alga of course there is a sense in which my attribution of semantics to autonomous agents is purely tautological after all i began by stating that a bacterium swimming upstream in the glucose gradient was acting on its own behalf in an environment defined an autonomous agent as a physical system able to act on its own behalf then asked what a physical system must be such that it can act on its own behalf now five chapters later it is hardly an independent deduction that autonomous agents are the proposed organization of matter energy and organization to which purposes can be ascribed in the sense of being able to act on their own behalf my definition is a definitional circle on the other hand while the definition is circular like f ma and darwins natural selection and fitness that does not mean that the set of codefined concepts surrounding my definition of an autonomous agent as a reproducing system that does a work cycle fails to touch the real world stones and chairs are not by my definition autonomous agents all living cells are and the stunning fact directly before us every day is that autonomous agents do manipulate the world on their own behalf watch a pair of nesting birds build their nest in short once we have autonomous agents and yuck and yum it appears that semantics enters the universe as the agents coevolve and behave on their own behalf with one another in the unfolding of a biosphere knowing what about knowing daniel dennett in his fine book darwins dangerous idea advances a hierarchy of forms of knowing if i may use that term that have arisen in evolution by darwinian means i find his hierarchy congenial and informative dennett envisions evolution as a sequence of kinds of construction cranes that bit by bit build up higherorder entities via variation and natural selection i do not disagree although i have placed far greater emphasis on the roles of selforganization in evolution here in investigations i am trying to point at the mysterious but utterly natural hopefulness in which an increasing diversity of broken symmetries in the universe creates the diversity of structures and processes that can constitute and identify ramified and ramifying sources of energy detect those sources of energy create devices and processes that couple to those sources of energy and generate yet more diversity that propagates macroscopic order even further i wonder in short at the naturalness and selfgeneraticity of dennetts cranes building cranes building cranes in biospheres perhaps planetary geologies and beyond but back to the past dennett distinguishes darwinian creatures pavlovian creatures popperian creatures and gregorian creatures a simple autonomous agent say a bacterium is a darwinian creature in its simplest version the creature evolves by mutation also recombination and natural selection for the moment no behavioral learning is to be considered so one or a colony or an ecosystem of darwinian creatures adapts more or less as darwin told us at the next level up say aplysia a nervous system is present and the creature is capable of stimulusresponse learning la pavlov indeed aplysia can learn very simple conditioned stimulithe later analogue is the bell causing the dog to salivate in expectation of food at the next level dennett perhaps properly reserves this for us vertebrates is the popperian creature popperian creatures in dennetts fine phrase have internal models of their world and can run the internal model with the clutch disengaged rather than running the model in real time in the real world this allows us lucky popperian creatures to allow our hypotheses to die in our stead i love that image beyond the popperian is the gregorian creaturenamely at least humans dennett makes the wonderful argument that we utilize our toolsliterally stone knives arrows digging sticks machine toolsto enlarge our shared world of facts and processes this enlarged shared world gives us more knowhow and more know that cultural evolution at some point begins to burst outofbounds hard rock music jangles the minarets of iran who knows what new cultural forms will blossom chinese cooking lands in cuba and cubanchinese cuisine is invented whats next under the sun who can say i very much like dennetts ladder of knowhow and eventual know that without invoking consciousness not because it is not worth invoking but because so little sensible has ever been said on the subject it seems worth asking how much of this hierarchy could be realized by simple molecular systems even without evoking nerve cells i would think a lot of this hierarchy could find molecular realizations for example bacteria and amoebae do have a kind of pavlovian learning already for they have receptors that accommodate to a constant level of a given signal ligand and sense instead a change from the current level this is not yet the association of a more or less arbitrary conditioned stimulus with an unconditioned stimulus but i can imagine chemistry to accomplish the latter as neurons are supposed to proliferate and form novel synaptic connections that survive if used and to mediate the linkage of conditioned to unconditioned stimulus why not envision a complex chemistry say very complex carbohydratesynthesis patterns sustained by complex sets of enzymes whose activities are modulated by the dierent carbohydrates themselves which is true of contemporary carbohydrate metabolism such a system might blindly try out variant patterns of synthesis until it could establish a selfsustaining web linking the carbohydrates the enzymes and certain protein receptors mediating the linkage between unconditioned and conditioned stimulus then maintain that linkage by positive feedback loops the image is not too far from how it is imagined that idiotype and antiidiotype immune networks work to sustain synthesis of a set of desired antibodies against an incoming pathogen in such networks for which there is modestly good evidence a given first antibody serves as an antigen that stimulates the body to produce a second antibody that binds to the unique amino acid sequences called the idiotype of the first antibody in turn the second antiidiotype antibody stimulates a third which stimulates a fourth but this series is likely to form feedback loops because the first and third antibody can often both bind to the same site on the second antibody hence the first and third antibodies are similar shapes in shape space it is not much of a stretch to think of the immune system as a conditioned stimulus response system popperian creatures why cannot the molecularsensing and hypothesistesting churning concerns of the bacterium as it senses a paramecium churn twenty cycles before kicking in the rotary motor or not such that the wee bacterium hides under a boulder of a grain of sand until the beast passes by are nerves necessary plants as noted are said to signal one another with complex secondary metabolites to characterize the particular kinds of insects infesting the glade there are arbitrary structural relations between the metabolite and the insect just as symbols in human language are often arbitrary with respect to the signified not bad for nerveless nonvertebrates i do get stuck at gregorian creatures even here the free and open creating of new symbol strings in a language wherever new sentences can be created is not that fundamentally dierent from the persistent open creation of new kinds of molecules in the biosphere as a whole if the conversation we recent twolegged ones are having with respect to our digging sticks and atomic bombs is impressive so too is the chemical conversation in any fullfledged ecosystem where we are all instrumental in the lives of one another i suppose i am naively driven to consider that the biosphere with its urgent diversity in which emboldened by all our knowhow we do get on with a very rich conversation may very early already have harbored all the levels of which dennett speaks we humans are just more gregarious with our vocal cords and email i guess smart place a biosphere lots to talk about four billion years of yammering slapstick comedy may have started a long time ago ethics and what of ethics does a whiff of ethical issue arise with autonomous agents yuck or yum from my point of view if i am an autonomous agent there are deep reasons for caution hume told us long ago about the naturalistic fallacy one cannot deduce ought from is from the fact that mothers care for their young we cannot deduce that they ought to do so hume argued from the fact that hitler set out to conquer europe and more and to kill jewry we cannot deduce that he ought to have done so indeed humes injunction underlies the caution of scientists about making ethical statements we scientists find the facts you citizens across the globe can argue the ethics but if hume warns us not to deduce ought from is where do values come from at all humes injunction against deduction from is to ought nevertheless began by recognizing the legitimacy of the category ought the eorts following hume to understand the meaning of ethical assertions have been long twisted arduous following the dictates of the logical positivists of the vienna circle that only those statements capable of verification were meaningful philosophers as famous as g e moore came to wonder if ethical assertions were merely emotive utterances it is wrong to kill becomes agggah does the positivist argument seem persuasive it has always amused me that the core injunction of the logical positivists only those statements that are empirically verifiable are meaningful is itself not empirically verifiable one is reminded of something about hoisting and petards john rawls of harvard has argued eloquently that our human notions of fairness derive from what we would all contractually agree to were we to know before birth that we would all be born with diering abilities and endowments thus equality before the law is one contract that rawls commends to us equality before the law is far more refined than the yuck or yum of the bacterium the emergence of ethics in the evolution of life on this planet is a fascinating issue i will content myself with wondering where value and the rudiments of intentionality come from in the physical universe in the first place and leave social contracts for other eorts where is the place of value in a world of fact so a short soliloquy facts are knowthat statements but knowhow preceded know that while fully aware of humes injunction i think that from the autonomous agents perspective yuck or yum is primary unavoidable and of the deepest importance to that agent i suppose we apply the darwinian criteria too much yuck this one and its progeny are gone from the future of the biosphere without attributing consciousness to an e coli or an autonomous agent we may create in the near future i cannot help but feel that the rudiments of value are present once autonomous agents are around and again without attributing consciousness once an autonomous agent is around is the rudiment of intentionality present if so another cornerstone of ethical activity has been laid ethical behavior requires first the logical possibility of behavior for which one is responsible you are not responsible for acts and eects beyond your control to act ethically you must first be able to act at all but what are acts in the first place daniel yamins is a brilliant young mathematician now entering harvard dan spent a summer with me at the santa fe institute before he learned to drive after an earlier summer spent in the laboratory of jack szostak at harvard where at age fourteen dan was learning to evolve rna molecules to bind arbitrary ligands dan and i struggled that summer to make the distinction between the doings of an autonomous agent and mere happenings in and around the autonomous agent note we say the e coli is swimming upstream in the glucose gradient to get dinner but all sorts of molecular vibrational rotational and translational motions are occurring what are actions and what are mere happenings i do not think we were successful in drawing a clean distinction between doings and happenings with clear mathematics but i sense that the distinction between doings and happenings dans happy phrasing is relevant for e coli tigers us trees and autonomous agents in general we will meet a similar problem in the next chapter when we attempt to distinguish between the function of a part of an organism and the other causal consequences of that part of the organism strange and interesting is it not that these issues all seem to arise with autonomous agents but not otherwise granted that we here seem to confront the language game circularity alluded to earlier yet i do truly think that the rudiments of semantics intentionality value and ethics arise with autonomous agents i do not think those rudiments suce to jump over humes naturalistic fallacy we cannot deduce ought from is in any concrete context but i think we have the categories of ought and is in the physical universe once we have autonomous agents 
 zoot suit a style of suit worn by african americans filipino americans and mexican americans during the 1930s and 1940s in chicano culture this style of dress is primarily associated with the pachucos of the 1940s the fashion at that time was to wear very baggy pants with pegged legs long jackets with high and sharp shoulder pads thicksoled shoes and long watch chains dangling from the belt an addition to the whole style common to chicanos was a particular haircut long with a ducktail and a widebrimmed hat the word zoot was known within the urban jazz culture of harlem and it meant something either exaggerated in performance or in style many african americans wore an extravagant style of clothing the baggy pegged pants and jackets with padded shoulders that later became known as the zoot suit in the novel invisible man by ralph ellison he describes the zootsuiters style walking slowly their shoulders swaying their legs swinging from their hips in trousers that ballooned upward from cuffs fitting snug about their ankles their coats long and hiptight with shoulders far too broad to be those of natural western men 1947 380 in the latenight jazz scenes of harlem this style was a killerdiller coat with a drapeshape reatpleats and shoulders padded like a lunatics cell 380 tyler makes the point that the zoot suit was an extremely symbolic costume which gave the wearer the look of a child in adult clothing the broad square shoulders gave a macho look to the youth and the fingertipped coat was made for fun and leisure the long baggy pants were made for dancing especially the jitterbug and the wide panama hats were another sign of adulthood the business of fun dancing and dating were the key characteristics displayed by zootsuiters it was an escape from drudgery and futile labor to the bliss of freewheeling movement in the city among youths in the new youth culture tyler 23 prominent black entertainers wore the zoot suit such as cab calloway sammy davis jr and duke ellington ellington performed at the orpheum in los angeles in 1941 and 1942 with a musical called jump for joy in which the performers wore zoot suits also known as gone with the wind suits after the style worn by clark gable in the movie by the same name even though the zoot suit was worn by the young men of several different races and ethnicities it is primarily identified with the pachucos of los angeles pachucos were mostly secondgeneration mexicans the sons of migrant laborers and workingclass immigrants pachucos created their own subculture an arrogant style of dressing a bilingual secret argot and for some individuals membership in petty criminal gangs the zoot suit became a symbolic disguise that identified the zootsuiter as neither a mexican nor an american it was not a bicultural or binational position but rather a position between cultures a hanging in space position the overly confident slow swagger of the pachuco today exemplified by the cholo made it appear in fact as if the zootsuiter were walking on air during the summer of 1943 the attention of the whole country was on los angeles when gangs of sailors and zootsuiters battled with each other in the streets of the city it is unclear if this was a race riot or a riot of patriotic sailors who attacked beat and stripped young mexican americans whom they perceived to be unpatriotic zootsuiters between the third and thirteenth of june zootsuiters were open targets much has been written about these riots from both literary and historical perspectives during the late 1970s the zoot suit received wide recognition and popularity with the production of a successful play by luis valdez in 1981 a film by the same name zoot suit was produced and directed by luis valdez with performances by actors daniel valdez and edward james olmos see also cholos pachucos references barker 1950 cosgrove 1989 ellison 1947 mazon 1984 oronacordova 1992 sanchez 1978 stone 1990 tyler 1994

or worry or anguished the zozobra is ritualistically burned at the beginning of the fiesta which symbolizes the end of destructiveness gloom and worry setting the tone for a successful fiesta the creation of zozobra was introduced into the fiesta in 1926 by will shuster who felt that the fiesta had become dull and commercialized throughout the years the image of zozobra changed from a simple twentyfoot puppet to the elaborate fortyfoot figure with animated eyes arms and mouth that he is today in 1969 shuster turned over the responsibility and copyright of zozobra to the kiwanis club of santa fe he is hung on a tall pole on a hill outside the city where the burning can be seen by the thousands of people who come to watch the death of gloom is supposed to resurrect happiness in

 three style when an architectural competition was announced for the new york public library on may 21 1897 dr john shaw billings the librarys executive director was determined that in his building design would not triumph over function he had in mind bostons newly built public library a beautiful but in his opinion poorly functioning building billings an exarmy physician was responsible for organizing the surgeon generals library and a celebrated medical index he was also an expert in hospital design and was thus familiar with building construction he drafted a plan for the new library whose most unorthodox feature was the location of the main reading room it was not located near the main entrance as was common practice but on an upper floor above the book stacks the terms of the architectural competition were strict and included detailed floor plans that the competitors were required to follow there were two stages intended to attract new talent as well as established firms first six architects were chosen from an open competition these six then advanced to a second stage where they competed against six invited firms that included not only mckim mead white the architects of the boston public library but also such luminaries as peabody stearns george b post and an upandcoming young firm carrre hastings the upandcomers carried the day mckim much to his chagrin not only lost but placed third behind howard cauldwell it was his own fault since he imperiously ignored the suggested plan and substituted his own arrangement carrre hastings conscientiously followed billings requirements the projected budget for the new library was not large 17 million and billings expected a relatively modest building that was not what he got all three designs were monumental carrre hastings and howard cauldwell used the modern french style which was more ornate and allowed for more articulation to the faade than the austere classical style that mckim opted for all incorporated giant columns rising the full height of the two floorscorinthian in mckims case ionic in the other two the completed building is corinthian the compositional strategies were roughly similar a monumental stair led to an elevated main floor the entrance was placed in the center more understated in mckims elegant design statuary and urns adorned the attic all three entrants shared a sense of what was beautiful and what was appropriate and all were concerned with conveying the same message of permanence dignity and of culture rooted in the past i mentioned the new york public library competition when i gave a public lecture in connection with a recent architectural competition for the new salt lake city public library the library board had conducted a national search for an architect visited new libraries across the country and solicited proposals from prominent architects they had narrowed their list to four firms charles gwathmey and robert siegel are respected new york architects with a long record of university buildings and museums including a new library of science industry and business for the new york public library system moshe safdie had built major civic buildings in israel canada and the united states and recently completed the public library in vancouver british columbia moore ruble yudell is a los angeles firm founded by the late charles moore with whom john ruble and buzz yudell built several university libraries and a public library in berlin will bruder the least wellknown of the four is a southwesterner and the architect of the new wellregarded phoenix public library i told my audience that i thought that the salt lake city library board would have a more difficult choice than their nineteenthcentury new york counterparts it was not a question of function the salt lake city librarians had prepared an equally exhaustive program of requirements so whichever architect was chosen commodity probably would be well served as for firmness i was reasonably sure that any of these experienced firms would build soundly it was the consideration of delight that would make the selection harder gwathmey and siegel design crisply detailed understated buildings in a latterday version of the international style safdie too is a modernist but he follows in the footsteps of pei and his buildings are frankly monumentalthe vancouver library had been likened to the roman coliseum moore ruble yudells work is different informal and animated their eclectic postmodern designs are likely to include ornament and architectural motifs drawn from their surroundings bruder on the other hand designs chic buildings that incorporate exposed structural elements rough industrial materials and sleek details building on the same site fulfilling the same functional requirements and using the same uptodate construction technology the four firms would produce libraries that would look different the library board awarded the commission to moshe safdie and a year later the plans for the new building were unveiled the new library will feature an unusual triangularshaped main building and a curving walllike structure that encloses a public square a hundred years ago it was taken for granted that the new york public library would be designed in some variant of the classical style today a public library can take many guises it can be relentlessly avantgarde like the new 15 billion national library in paris where the books are housed in four lshaped 22story glass towers and the readers are lodged in underground rooms which the london times described as a series of rectangular salons identical of course where you can admire the ultrasmooth gray concrete steel grille ceilings and the expanses of african veneer1 a new library can be comfortably modernist like the new british library in london which the independent humorously described as a giant municipal building that has made its way from scandinavia having crashed headfirst through an english brickworks on the way2 tom beebys handsome harold t washington library in chicago on the other hand is distinctly oldfashioned with rusticated stone walls and carved brick ornaments that are a literal evocation of the citys nineteenthcentury architectural tradition instead of trendy plastic or metal chairs the reading areas are equipped with solid wood tables and traditional courthouse chairs james ingo freeds main public library in san francisco on the other hand is both old and new the imposing granite and stainless steel exterior is more or less classical on one faade and more or less modernist on another the coexistence of different architectural styles is nothing new in a 1913 essay titled style in american architecture ralph adams cram identified no less than seven contemporary styles although he called them tendencies five were traditional mckims pure classicism the beauxarts french modern colonial which was associated with houses but was also appearing in larger buildings such as the johns hopkins university campus crams own high gothic and a looser interpretation of the medieval style as practiced by his partner goodhue two were new steelframe construction which cram described as an enfant terrible and what he called the secessionistsfrank lloyd wright in chicago the greene brothers in pasadenawho exhibited a strongly developed enmity to archaeological forms of any kind cram was not sanguine about the future but he nevertheless concluded chaos then confronts us in that there is no single architectural following but legion and in that fact lies the honor of our art for neither is society one or ever at one with itself3 cram is right most historical periods are marked by stylistic confusion it is stylistic consensus that is unusual there was such a brief consensus in the late 1890s when both architects and the american public under the influence of the immensely popular worlds columbian exposition embraced classicism at least for public buildings that unanimity lasted long enough for the new york public library competition but it began to unravel shortly after as crams essay makes clear there was also a consensus in the 1920s at least among progressive architects that consensus did not last either after 1940 mies van der rohe gave up the freeflowing plans and asymmetrical massing that had characterized the barcelona pavilion and the tugendhat house and began designing buildings whose details and materials were modern but whose layout and composition were distinctly classical in the 1920s le corbusier proclaimed the five points of a new architecture the building raised on stilts the roof garden the frame structure that allowed a free plan the free faade and the horizontal ribbon window he too had second thoughts thirty years later his wonderful chapel at ronchamps had massive sculpted wall that concealed a concrete frame the roof far from being flat resembled a billowing nuns coif le corbusier who had coined the famous expression a house is a machine for living in now adopted distinctly unmachinelike building materials such as crudely finished concrete exposed brick roughened stucco and fieldstone this volte face gave rise to the socalled brutalist style which had a worldwide influence shaping the work of architects as dissimilar as james stirling and paul rudolph and ultimately opening the door to postmodern stylistic experiments such as charles moores little house in the berkeley hills the inconstancy of the international style practitioners should have been expected the history of western architecture is of architects searching for rules only to bend and break them even classicism which appears at first glance to be highly regimented is not immune as far as we know the ancient greeks used only three orders doric ionic and corinthian vitruvius describes them and also refers to a tuscan order which is a roman invention roman too is the socalled composite order an ornate blend of ionic and corinthian the vault the arch and the dome unknown to the greeks were other roman additions to the classic canon architects have been stretching classical rules ever since breaking pediments flattening pilasters magnifying and shrinking columns rusticating masonry a sixteenthcentury french architect philibert de lorme invented a french order edwin lutyens devised an order based on mughal precedents for the viceroys house in new delhi more recently allan greenberg created an order for the offices of the secretary of state that incorporated the great seal of the united states michael graves designed classical caryatids columns carved in the shape of human figures to support the pedimented front of an office building for the walt disney company in burbank while the supports of the porch of the erechtheon in athens take the form of graceful maidens graves caryatids are the seven dwarfs the headquarters of a company whose logo is a pair of mouse ears obviously demands a different decorum from a temple in the past religious buildings and palaces required a narrow stylistic range as architectural commissions grew to include civic and commercial buildings warehouses factories shops and cinemas houses and weekend housesevery sort of buildinga single style no longer sufficed gothic is an evocative style for churches but despite walpoles efforts it is illadapted to houses romanesque makes imposing city halls but is too heavy to be applied to skyscrapers the international style makes striking small buildings but monotonous large ones shingle style cottages are pleasing a shingle style home depot is ridiculous as cram wisely observed architecture is nothing unless it is intimately expressive and if utterly different things clamor for voicing different also must be their architectural manifestation4 the great architectsbrunelleschi palladio wren richardson lutyensregularly looked to the past for inspiration in 1965 richard meier built the smith house which has been called the first international style revival building like all revivalists meier picks and chooses at first glance the smith house has all the stylistic hallmarks of a le corbusier villa of the 1920s a free plan flat roof white walls pipe railings horizontal ribbon windows a ramp yet it is built out of wood and steel not masonry the white walls are painted wood siding not stucco the details are more refined the plateglass sheets are larger the structure lighter the result is an international style that is filtered through american consciousness and shaped by american technology it is like thomas jefferson building classical columns out of woodthe same but different although art historians use terms like gothic revival and greek revival to distinguish later reincarnations of styles architects look at history differently for the serious architect the past exists not as a legacy to be possessed through a selfconscious act of the modern will writes roger scruton in the aesthetics of architecture but as an enduring fact an ineliminable part of an extended present5 that is why architects whether they are inigo jones or louis kahn make architectural pilgrimages to the mediterranean roots of western architecture sketchbook in hand they plumb the secrets of the master builders of the past consciousness of the past may also explain why architects tend to resist being categorized according to style they instinctively understand that the history of architectureincluding the presentis a continuity rather than a series of episodes stylistic consistency is much admired today but it was not always so in 1419 filippo brunelleschi began the foundling hospital in florence whose delicate arcade of corinthian columns surmounted by pedimented windows is generally considered the first building of the renaissance at the very same time he was building a great dome over the crossing of the cathedral of florence in a style that was not classical but distinctly gothic pointed arches and all the german architect karl friedrich schinkel is best known for his severe classical public buildings such as the superb altes museum in berlin but he also worked in other styles gothic in churches and picturesque italianate in villas mckim mead white favored the classical style for public buildings and palatial residences but built norman parish churches shingle style summer retreats french renaissance mansions and american colonial country houses john russell pope an eclectic master designed beautiful picturesque tudor georgian and colonial country estates edwin lutyens was another classicist whose residential work was eclectic domestic architects had to be adaptable because house styles changed according to fashion in the united states tudor was popular in the 1900s as was the free style cotswold and french provincial appeared in the 1920s after the 1930s influenced by the restoration of williamsburg american colonial returned to favor the cotswold style with its relatively severe details and blunt forms created a very different setting from french provincial which tended to have more delicate details from free style with its almost rustic atmosphere or from sturdy colonial since historic styles carry cultural overtones using different styles was also a way for architectsand clientsto say different things if architectural style is a languagean analogy that is deeply flawedit is closer to slang than to grammatical prose architectural styles are mutable unregulated improvised architects break the rules and invent new ones in part this is simply the irrepressible urge of creative individuals in part architects break stylistic rules because they can after all most of the rules that govern building designfire codes building codes zoning laws budgets programmatic requirements engineering normsare outside the architects control stylistic rules are firmly within his purview since architecture is so intensely competitive doing something unexpected unusual or just different is a way to be noticed to rise above the crowd in addition to historical styles there have also been styles associated with individual architects the palladian style made its way from andrea palladio to inigo jones from him to colen campbell and lord burlington and thence to thomas jefferson it reappears in the work of contemporary classicists such as allan greenberg h h richardsons influence was considerably shorterlived but for at least 20 years richardsonian romanesque rolled over the united states like an aesthetic juggernaut in crams colorful phrase mies van der rohes steelandglass style likewise prevailed for more than two decades and his characteristic ibeam window mullion can still be seen in contemporary curtain walls buildings like jones palladian queens house in greenwich adler sullivans richardsonian romanesque auditorium building in chicago and gordon bunshafts miesian lever house are not copies but satisfying originals however most personal styles are not easily adaptable a building in wrights unmistakable prairie style for example simply looks like a knockoff some personal styles are simply too obsessive which is probably why frank furness and the equally idiosyncratic barcelona architect antonio gaud never attracted a following inigo jones consciously based his work on the architecture of palladio but he did not think of himself as working in the palladian style any more than palladio would have referred to the classical style although renaissance architects described their architecture as allanticain the antique mannerthey took it for granted that the history of architecture was a progression the romans improved on the greeks and they would improved on the romans according to the architecture historian peter collins the use of the word style to designate the architecture of a particular period or country is relatively late he cites james stuart and nicholas revetts antiquities of athens published in 1762 and credited with inaugurating the classical revival in england the authors both architects referred to the grecian and roman style of building6 the latin root of style is stilus a stilus was the sharppointed tool used to write on wax tablets and by inference stilus also referred to the way that something was written this sense of technique carried over to english and the original meaning of style was those features of literary composition that belonged to the form rather than to the substance of the matter being expressed the seventeenthcentury english musical composer samuel wesley put it neatly style is the dress of thought jacquesfranois blondel who was louis xvs architect and who founded the first fulltime school of architecture in europe in 1750 adopted this literary meaning as a metaphor and described architectural style as a buildings characterfor example rustic regal or heroic style in the organization of faades and in the decoration of rooms is the poetry of architecture he taught his students which alone makes all the architects compositions truly interesting7 literary style described the way that something was written expressed or performed architectural style in blondels sense describes the way that something was built although architecture is often defined in terms of abstractions such as space light and volume buildings are above all physical artifacts the experience of architecture is palpable the grain of wood the veined surface of marble the cold precision of steel the textured pattern of brick but exactly what do we see when we look at brickwork we see the joints between the bricks and the mortar which can be flush or scraped out to create shadows the bonding patterns the way that the bricks turn the corner the surrounding of openings and the connection between the brick wall and the foundation or the eaves what we see are details details are a major preoccupation of the architect once the overall form of a building is determinedthe masterly correct and magnificent play of masses brought together in lightthere remains the question not only of what materials are to be used and how these will be assembled but also of how the hundreds of parts of the building are to be designed from the door frames and the window sills to the railings and the baseboards the function of a baseboard is to cover the joint between the wall and the floor and secondarily to protect the wall from scuffing there are dozens of ways that this can be done baseboards can be prominent or discreet a complicated assembly of board cap and base or a simple strip of hardwood or nothingmany modern architects dispense with baseboards altogether the baseboards in my living room are twelve inches tall they are not wood but cast iron since they are really disguised radiators my house was built in 1908 influenced by the british free style of voysey and baillie scott and to further preserve a simple rustic atmosphere the architect had the baseboardsradiators painted to resemble wood railings have a simple functionthey must be sturdy enough to support us if we lean on them and they must provide a secure handhold if railings are open the spaces between the supports and the rails should be small enough to prevent children from falling through classical railings developed during the renaissance consist of balusters supporting a handrail balusterslittle columnscan have a single or a double swelling curve or a vase shape fabricated in wood or masonry they can be round or square in crosssection and plain or highly ornamented railings can be replaced by parapets with pierced screens these can be stone or metal bronze wrought or cast iron the screens can be simple xshapes intertwining geometrical patterns or complicated floral figures as in art nouveau staircases perhaps the simplest open railings are those of the great adirondack camps whose builders mimicked xshaped wroughtiron railings in unpeeled rustic tree trunks modern railings are usually metal in his early villas le corbusier used whitepainted pipe railings to create a nautical image in later buildings like the carpenter center for the visual arts at harvard flat steel bars take the place of pipes the railings in mies van der rohes buildings usually have only a single intermediate rail located precisely halfway between the handrail and the floor the vertical stanchions the handrail and the rail are made of identical square steel bars the railings in louis kahn buildings tend to be parapets but where he is obliged to use an open railing the design is as simple as possible i have seen a short stair railing that consisted of a single bronze bar bent at each end to form the uprights richard meier uses metal railings too but because there are sometimes as many as six horizontal rails the visual effect is more pronouncedthey resemble staffs in sheet music when brutalism was in fashion railings were correspondingly heavy concrete beams wide enough to sit on but unpleasant to the touch or massive wood balustrades as solid as fenders on a truck dock the vogue among many younger architects today is toward lightness and exposed construction and railings reflect that fashion too the screens of the railings of peter roses canadian center for architecture in montreal are industriallooking perforated sheets of anodized aluminum prominently bolted to the stanchions bernard tschumi substitutes steel cables complete with turnbuckles for the intermediate horizontal rails of the ramp railings of lerner hall at columbia university another nautical reference but to a yacht rather than a steamship these solutions appear mannered compared to the simple railing that i m pei designed for the east building of the national gallery the stainless steel handrail highlights the solidity of the rosecolored tennessee marble by appearing to float in midair since it is supported by continuous sheets of tempered glass embedded in the floor the transparent railings of i m peis east building are understated elegant and luxuriouslike the building beauty will result from the form and correspondence of the whole with respect to the several parts taught palladio of the parts with regard to each other and of these again to the whole8 the successful relationship of the details to each other and to the building is governed by the architects sense of style that is why the architect of my house painted the radiators to resemble wood a technologically inclined architect might have painted them silver a minimalist would dispense with baseboards and hide the radiators in the wall the role of details is not to complement architecture details are architecture the aesthetic understanding of architecture writes roger scruton is inseparable from a sense of detail9 mies van der rohe is supposed to have said god is in the details he did not mean that details are functionally important although they are or that good details prolong the life of a building although they do he meant that details are the soul of architecture that is why just as an archaeologist can reconstruct a pot from a few shards or a paleontologist can surmise the form of a prehistoric animal from bone fragments it is possible to divine the architects idea of a building by examining its details the house that robert venturi built for his mother in 1964 shook the foundations of the international style much of this effect was the result of details although venturi obviously was working in a modernist idiomthere is a strip window and a steelpipe railinghe also incorporated distinctly unmodernist features such as trim both inside and out classical architects use a large variety of moldingsfillet astragal egg and dart ogeethat can be combined and recombined to great decorative effect the international style in its effort to do away with ornament outlawed trim walls were flat planes windows had no frames joints between materials were simply hairline cracks the conspicuous exterior dado the baseboards and the chairrails in the vanna venturi house were hardly classical moldingsthey were merely boards with chamfered edgesyet they challenged the assumption that trim and modernism were incompatible coming through the front door of the vanna venturi house one immediately senses that it is an unusual place a broad stair rises beside the fireplace then peters out to almost nothing the fireplace looks like an abstract sculpture but it has a traditional mantelpiece a freestanding column la corbusier stands beside a chairrail then there is the furniture ever since the tugendhat housefor which mies had designed the furnitureit was taken for granted that modern houses required modern furniture venturi has explained that i designed the house so my mothers old furniture c 1925 plus some antiques would look good in it10 instead of the iconic benttube breuer chairs there are homely ladderback chairs around the dining table instead of an eames lounge chair and ottoman a comfortable stuffed sofa it is a contradictory atmospherethe international style willfully distorted through the lens of traditional bourgeois domesticity whether one is looking up at the tall dome of the pantheon descending the spiraling vortex of wrights guggenheim museum or standing in the living room of venturis small house the experience of architecture is above all the experience of being in a separate distinct world that is what distinguishes architecture from sculptureit is not an object but a place the sense of being in a special place that is a threedimensional expression of the architects imagination is one of the distinctive pleasures of architecture to create a strong sense of place the surroundings must be all of a piece space mass shapes and materials must reflect the same sensibility that is why details are so important a jarring detail or an inconsistencysomething out of placeand the fantasy begins to crumble yes fantasy illusion has been a part of architecture ever since the ancient greeks made columns with a gently swelling taper to deceive the eye this is not to say that architecture is stage dcor when the wind blows the canvas scenery blows over the building resists the elements architecture surrounds and shelters us it is the real world but it is also a vision the postmodern movement that followed the vanna venturi house was relatively shortlived but it had an important consequence it broke the stranglehold of modernism leaving designers free to explore other forms of expression the profusion of styles that ensued is demonstrated by the work of three gifted but vastly different architects allan greenberg hugh newell jacobsen and enrique norten allan greenberg is a confirmed classicist he does not consider this an anomaly to be truly modern he writes means finding the dynamic balance between eternal human values and the specific demands of the present classical architecture provides the means to achieve this balance because it is the most comprehensive architectural language that human beings have yet developed11 although greenberg looks to the past his is not the attitude of an archeologist like carrre hastings and generations of architects before them greenberg approaches classicism as a tradition to be studied absorbedthen extended early in his career after emigrating to the united states from south africa greenberg was employed writing design standards for courthouses which led to an unusual commission the conversion of an empty supermarket into a courthouse he gave the commercial building in manchester connecticut a new faade dominated by a large arch overscaled voussoirs and a pediment inside the barrelvaulted ceiling of the lobby was supported by a tuscan order greenberg had graduated from yale in 1965 and like many of his contemporaries was experimenting with the new freedom offered by postmodernism however unlike venturi and moore greenberg was not coyly introducing classical elements into a modernist building he was returning to classical roots from this modest beginning over the next two decades came a variety of commissions a suite of rooms for the secretary of state in the united states department of state building several college and university buildings and a roman catholic church his commercial work included a newspaper office building in athens georgia a new entrance for bergdorf goodman on fifth avenue in manhattan and a flagship store for tommy hilfiger in beverly hills greenberg is also known for large country houses both in the united states and in europe like lutyens and john russell pope he ventures stylistically farther afield in his residential workusing georgian and american colonial styles one of his early houses was inspired by mount vernon another by palladios unfinished villa thiene several are picturesque rambling affairs whose relaxed informality recalls the best work of mckim mead white one of my favorite greenberg houses is a cottage set among windblown dunes on the eastern seaboard completed in 1992 the lowlying building is shingled but it is not exactly shingle style recent shingle style buildings are often broken down into many small parts giving them a fussy and nervous appearance such seaside cottages look as if a good wind could blow them away greenbergs aim here is to make a heavyweight building of great solidity that is rooted firmly in the dune scrub the onestory atlantic faade is almost perfectly symmetrical a large arched window flanked by two semicircular bays rotund sentinels standing against the ocean winds the twostory landward side is more informal ringed by a sheltered porch massivity informs the details sturdy tuscan columns a heavy cornice at the eaves of the large roof rugged window frames the sense of robustness is accentuated by occasional delicacy the arched window incorporates scrolled brackets that support an elegant reverse ogee molding at the eaves inside the fireplace has a brick hearth a slate lintel and a wood surround whose almost modern simplicity is softened by a cavetto molding beneath the mantelpiece the ceiling is supported by exposed trusses of rough reused timbers although most people would describe this house as traditional this is not an exercise in a particular historical style there is a nod here to the british arts and crafts architect c f a voysey and it is obvious that greenberg has looked at lutyens country houses but this is a modern house although designed by an architect with a classical sensibility it admirably fulfills palladios call for a correspondence of the whole with the parts and the parts with the whole hugh newell jacobsen studied at yale under louis kahn worked for philip johnson and opened his own office in 1958 he established himself as a premier residential architect winning commissions in the united states and abroad and receiving numerous design awards several of the awards were for restoration of historic buildings notably the renwick gallery in washington dc and the htel talleyrand in paris a modernist by training and inclination jacobsen was nevertheless affected by the winds of change unleashed by venturis little house starting in 1980 he evolved a hybrid style in which american regional forms and materials are combined with international style precision spareness and simplicity a house on nantucket in shingles and white trim looks vernacular until one notices the careful proportions and refined elegant details such as tall french doors in the living room that slide into wall pockets that also conceal shutters and screen doors a postandbeam caribbean guest house with broad overhangs has the ingenuous simplicity of a beach shack the palladian plan and templelike pavilions of an ohio residence pay homage to the local greek revival an ohio country house recalls a boardandbatten gothic revival farmhouse i endeavor to design buildings that express a sense of belonging jacobsen says buildings that reflect or abstract the nearby architecture and the traditions dictated by the climate and local materials12 the palmedo house built in 1988 reinterprets the american colonial architecture of its locationlong island at first glance the six pavilions resemble a little village a little amish village judging from the austere white wood siding the prim details and the identical pitched roofs each pavilion is a perfect little house with identical square and vertical multipaned windows that open by sliding into cunning wall pockets this sounds precious but jacobsen is not a romantic the central house contains the living room a threestory space open to the roof although the multipaned windows are present at an upper level of the wall the corner of the room is glazed with large mullionless sheets of plate glass offering dramatic views of long island sound this is an international style device as is the economy of detail and the clean cool atmosphere of the interior on the other hand the fireplace which in an orthodox international style house would be painted brick or bushhammered concrete is decorously built into the wall which gives the room a traditional civilized air the chief idea here is to highlight the tension between old and new between the traditional clapboarded architecture and the demands of modern life whereas greenberg seamlessly resolves this tension jacobsen allows it to surface if this sounds like textbook postmodernism it is not jacobsen artlessly combines new and old without the slightest hint of irony jacobsen reacts to the collapse of modernism by seeking a compromise position while greenberg anchors himself in the certainties of classicism enrique norten the youngest of the three takes a different coursehe is trying to put modernism back together again norten who studied at cornell established his office in his native mexico city in 1985 in a relatively short time he produced an impressive body of work that includes institutional commercial and residential buildings his major projects are a services building for the media giant televisa and the national school of theater both incorporate bulging metal shellroofs that recall the 1950s buildings of the french architectengineer jean prouv prouv was intent on applying new methods of construction particularly industrialization and prefabrication his buildings extremely light and assembled from standardized elements were real machines for living norten too is preoccupied with industrial building technologies the lighter the better doubletensed glass curtain walls are mysteriously supported by a steelframe roofs hang by steel cables from steel masts slender canted columns brace a glassroofed portico railings in a norten design are almost always opportunities for structural legerdemain suspended sheets of glass stretched steel cables perforated metal screens in 1994 norten built a house for himself and his family on a tight urban site in mexico city the threestory street faade is mostly a blank concrete wall the wall facing the interior walled patio is entirely glass the main living floor is open except for the kitchen the upper bedroom floor is shaded and given privacy by a redwood louvered screen a functionalist style pervades the house the clinical cabinetwork is whitepainted wood a concrete wall in the dining room is bare save for the regular pattern of the formwork ties and the pour lines marks the windows are large sections of plate glass in simple aluminum frames a 10foot section slides aside to entirely open the dining room to the patio the sliding wall recalls the disappearing windows in mies van der rohes tugendhat house but the resemblance ends here mies spare interior is opulent and assertive nortens is austere almost monastic a neutral background for family life this is an unsentimental idea of the home not exactly a machine for living but certainly machinelike in its precision and rational layout like greenberg and jacobsen norten reflects on the past although his house has little to do formally with the international style of the flatroofed stucco villas of the 1920sexcept for the whitepainted circular steel columnsit shares that periods ambitions it is highly abstract idealistic technophile and lacking in applied ornament decoration results not from trim but from the surface quality of the different materialsconcrete red oak flooring etched glassand from the relentless articulation of structural connections nortens buildings exhibit another feature of the international style they are placeless that is while they carefully respond to the specifics of the program and the site they do not explicitly acknowledge their immediate regional context whether they are in mexico or new mexicowhere norten is building a heritage centerthe style is the same understated coolly competent cosmopolitan whether one prefers the work of greenberg jacobsen or norten is a matter of taste i happen to like all three the buildings are different yet the three architects have something in common they are serious about what they are doing that is their buildings exhibit a strong sense of conviction they pay enormous attention to details they are disciplined but they understand their selfimposed rules well enough to occasionally break them moreover while their architecture is built with a great sense of style it is never merely stylized that is because in their buildings stylethe manner of expressionis always in the service of contentthat which is being expressed style without content quickly degenerates into caricature like a speaker who makes grand gestures and rhetorical flourishes but has nothing to say the buildings of greenberg jacobsen and norten on the contrary have a great deal to tell us about our past our surroundings and ourselves greenberg jacobsen and norten do not describe what they do in terms of style i think that there are a number of reasons that architects are uncomfortable talking about the subject a suspicion of style is a heritage of the modern movement which preached against the arbitrary dictates of style and fashion while maintaining an unspoken but rigid stylistic consistency so deeprooted is this teaching that it remains a moral stricture on most architects whether or not they are modernists perhaps another reason for the reluctance to discuss style is fear fear that being linked to a particular style is to be put in a boxlike most creative people architects dislike being categorized also fear that talking about style will make architecturea serious businesssound frivolous better to leave that to interior decorators and fashion designers professions that architects regard with a mixture of disdain and envy finally there is an unspoken fear of style because it is subject to the whims and the fancies of fashion that fear at least seems to me to be illfounded an architecture that recognizes styleand fashionwould not be an architecture that is introspective and selfreferential as are so many contemporary buildings it would be part of the worldnot architecture for architects but architecture for the rest of us and that would not be a bad thing coda richard morris hunt was the most celebrated american architect of the late nineteenth century his preeminence is reflected by his appointment as the architect of two important national works the centerpiece building of the chicago worlds columbian exposition and the pedestal for the statue of liberty he was feted at home and abroad hunt was the first architect to receive an honorary doctorate from harvard and the first american to receive a gold medal from the royal institute of british architects and he was made an honorary member of the french acadmie and a chevalier of the legion of honor a hundred years later his counterpart is frank o gehry since being awarded the prestigious pritzker prize in 1989 gehry has gone on to win more honors than any other living architect including such major arts awards as the dorothy and lillian gish prize a nonarchitectural award of which he is the first recipient and the japanese praemium imperiale the nobel of the art world even the staid american institute of architects which had previously shunned gehry in lieu of more mainstream practitioners awarded him its top accolade the aia gold medal no pair of architects could be more dissimilar than this distinctly odd couple the proper high society favorite of the gilded age and the untidy bohemian from santa monica yet they bear comparison they were both late bloomers gehry was 48 when he gained national recognition until then he had been running his own office in los angeles for almost twenty years building shopping centers suburban offices department stores and apartments in competent but unremarkable renditions of la modern the project that brought him to national attention was his own remodeled house a nondescript bungalow encased in an unsettling cubist composition of unpainted plywood corrugated metal and chainlink fencing the odd shapes and unorthodox materials marked gehry as a maverick that was in 1978 unexpectedly he attracted a broad range of commissions not only residential clients but also museums public institutions universities corporations and developers and not only in the united states but around the world hunt was 43 when he came into his own he had established an architectural practice in new york in 1855 almost immediately on his return from the ecole des beauxarts he was moderately successful achieving local renown for the tribune building an early new york skyscraper despite his parisian background hunt worked in the prevalent ruskinian gothic style of his presbyterian hospital in downtown manhattan the architectural critic montgomery schuyler wrote the building is of gothic design with very red brick and very irregular stone dressings which it must be confessed regretfully are not pleasing to the eye3 for his next project the lenox library hunt tried something different he borrowed from the french neogrec style popularized by labrouste in the bibliothque sainte genevive adding renaissance details and his own characteristically vigorous surface modeling the result was a startling departure from convention a monochrome limestone block of imposing dignity the lenox library which stood on fifth avenue on the site of the presentday frick collection marked a shift in architectural taste away from ruskin to a grand and frankly aesthetic classicism the 1880s was a decade of great prosperity and newly wealthy new yorkers eagerly sought out hunts architectural blend of good taste and ostentatious display he obliged them in a string of highprofile commissions magnificent mansions along fifth avenue country houses on long island and palatial cottages in newport rhode island hunt died in 1895 but in the last seven years of his life he completed more than fifty projects biltmore house in asheville north carolina is a good example of his stylistic prowess hunt modeled the design of this 250room residence on the chteau de blois whose style is not the severe classicism of the italian renaissance favored by architects such as charles mckim but the more ornate and picturesque french renaissance to a modern visitor the spires turrets and steep slate roofs of biltmore recall disneylands sleeping beauty castle which is not surprising since disney also used a loire valley chateauthe chteau dussas his model but the comparison does hunt an injustice for his design is neither prettified nor quaint his client george w vanderbilt was a young bachelor he married soon after the house was finished and for him hunt created an architecture that is robust masculine and immensely selfassured not in the least like a fairytale vanderbilt was drawn to french chateaux which hunt showed him during a whirlwind european tour since young george and his wealthy family imagined themselves american aristocrats there are coats of arms bearing vs all over the house hunt provides his client with an imagined regal setting but deals with the past in his own peculiar way although he modeled the building on blois he makes no attempt to create a replica of the sixteenthcentury chateau but draws details from other buildings of the period and recombines them into an original whole nor does he try to create the illusion that this is a sixteenthcentury buildingthere is no artificial weathering no aging effect no simulated historicism the interior is modern bright and open the focus of the main floor is a glassroofed conservatory a common nineteenthcentury feature the stonework of the house is impeccable much crisper and more sharply defined than at blois hunt was no antiquarian and modern american technology abounds the floors of fireproof hollow tile are supported by steel ibeams and the steep slate roofs by steel roof trusses cast iron replaces wrought iron and highquality bricks fired in the estate brickworks backup the limestone walls equally novel are the elevators and telephones electrical lighting hot and cold running water and forced air central heating there is no doubt that for hunt biltmore is an uptotheminute modern building that is part of its style too like hunt frank gehry enlists novel materials in his buildings the guggenheim museum in bilbao spain for example is clad in titanium previously used chiefly for building aircraft the metallic walls curve twist and turn one part of the building slides under an adjoining bridge another emerges from a reflecting pool bilbainos refer to the museum as the artichoke which comes close to describing it if you can imagine a gleaming metallic artichoke more than two hundred feet high the seeming disordera chaotic collision of formshas no architectural precedent this is not sculptural architecture it is walkin sculpture the plan is the generator preached le corbusier but with gehry the plan is the result he appears to design from the outside in the building as a composition comes first the interior spaces follow this implies that he shoehorns functions into the building which is not the case the guggenheim has three distinct types of gallery spaces traditional skylit rooms for displaying its permanent collection of early modernist art a long boatlike space for temporary installations and 11 smaller galleries each with its own character each dedicated to the works of a selected living artist the artichoke accommodates them all the building may appear offhanded but there is nothing haphazard about the way it is organized gehrys talent is his exceptional formal imagination his skill as an architect is to reconcile the forms he imagines with the functional demands of his client and of course to find ways to build those forms this is generally done without fuss the titanium sheets simply follow the churning surfaces like shingles on a shingle style roof limestone is used in a similarly unaffected fashion without articulated joints gehry shares a minimalist approach to details with the early architects of the international style but he deploys these details to different ends by removing familiar elements such as coping strips fascias and trim he accentuates the sculptural quality of his buildings there are no roofs or walls or windows in the guggenheim there are only swirling and twisting planes of metal stone and glass an architecture critic once described gehry as a smart man from hollywood which nicely captures the architects blend of exuberant showmanship and canny behindthescenes savvy although sophisticated building techniques and innovative materials play a major role in gehrys buildings like hunt he keeps technology off center stage in that regard he repudiates the mannered industrial style that pervades the work of many contemporary architects neither is he nostalgic about the past gehry rejects both the moralistic functionalism of the international style and the traditions of classicism architects have broken rules in the past but rarely this unequivocally and totally gehry like hunt has changed the course of architecture that is he has made us look at our surroundings in a different way the world of gehrys buildings is at first glance an odd place the line between order and disorder is a thin one and it is difficult to know what is intended and what is accidental but his colliding forms and agitated architecture are curiously unthreatening this is the way we live today gehry seems to be saying why not enjoy it

 introduction older adults are frequently counseled to lose weight even though there is little evidence that overweight is associated with increased mortality in those over age 65 six large controlled populationbased studies of nonsmoking older adults have investigated the association between body mass index bmi and mortality controlling for relevant covariates 1 2 3 4 5 6 all studies found excess risk for persons with very low bmi but that persons with moderately high bmi had little or no extra risk except in certain small subsets a review of 13 studies of older adults drew similar conclusions 7 many healthy older adults report gradual weight gain throughout adult life it may be that a small amount of gradual weight gain is normative and associated with the most robust health as we age it has been suggested that weight standards be adjusted upwards for age 8 such recommendations remain controversial however because the number of studies of older persons is fairly small and because few studies have examined the relation of bmi to quality of life or years of healthy life yhl in the elderly 9 in older adults risk factors may have a greater effect on health than on mortality if so then behavior change trials of weight modification might be more successful if they were evaluated on improved health rather than on decreased mortality clinical trials powered to detect differences in yhl would often require fewer subjects than trials to detect survival differences or cardiovascular events 10 in this paper we study whether bmi at baseline is associated with living longer andor with more years of being healthy in a cohort of older adults for whom risk factors subclinical disease and morbidity are well characterized the goal is to determine whether analyses based on years of life yol or on yhl would provide substantively different results and which measure would yield more powerful evaluations of weight modification interventions in older adults materials and methods study design the cardiovascular health study the cardiovascular health study chs is a populationbased longitudinal study of 5888 adults aged 65 and older at baseline 11 subjects were recruited from a random sample of the medicare eligibility lists in four us counties extensive baseline data were collected for all subjects using a baseline home interview an annual mail questionnaire and annual clinic examinations additional information was collected in a brief telephone interview 6 months after each scheduled visit two cohorts were followed one with 7 years of followup n 5201 and the second all african american n 687 with 4 years of followup to date data collection began in 1989 and followup is virtually complete for all surviving subjects 12 body mass index bmi was calculated as measured weight in kilograms divided by the square of measured height in meters a report from the national heart lung and blood institute classifies normal weight without reference to age as a bmi of 185 to 249 overweight as 25 to 299 and obesity as 300 and higher 13 we consider separately the group with bmi between 185 and 20 which was associated with lower survival in studies cited above years of life and years of healthy life yol is the number of years that a person lived in the 7 years after baseline yhl is the number of years in which the person was healthy and is similar in concept to qualityadjusted lifeyears healthy year equivalents or active life expectancy 14 we based yhl on selfrated health is your health excellent very good good fair or poor evgfp which was collected every 6 months evgfp is a simple but wellknown measure which has been studied in detail 15 16 and is predictive of health events in many studies 17 because we are examining health status over time we added a sixth health state dead data were available about 93 of the time we used linear interpolation to estimate missing data when there were known values before and after the missing value bringing the percent complete to 95 18 for this analysis we defined yhl as the number of years of 7 in which a person reported excellent very good or good health were healthy yhl ranges from 0 for persons who were never in excellent very good or good health to 7 years for persons who were healthy throughout since people reported their health every 6 months yhl has a reasonably continuous distribution a drawback of this simple definition of healthy is that it does not distinguish between fair or poor health and death since all are considered not healthy we also used an alternative approach which assigns a different value to each level of evgfp 19 preliminary results were similar for the two approaches however and we report results using only the simpler definition the calculations had to be modified to include the 438 persons in the second african american cohort who have been followed only 4 years to date for those persons and for 70 persons in the first cohort who did not have complete data we estimated the last 4 years of yol and yhl from their age sex and health at the end of 3 years using validated methods presented elsewhere 20 that article showed that estimated 4year yol and yhl were unbiased for the african american cohort in the primary analysis we used observed 7year yol and yhl when they were available and observed 3year yol and yhl plus 4year estimated yol and yhl when they were not about 10 of the sample we performed all analyses with and without the persons who had partially estimated data to ensure that the estimation had not distorted the findings covariates the goal is to examine the association of yol and yhl with bmi to adjust for possible confounding we chose baseline covariates that were prevalent in the elderly related to mortality and morbidity in previous studies and likely to be related to bmi selfreported covariates include age gender smoking never or former history of arthritis cancer diabetes fair or poor selfrated health status limitations in activities of daily living or in instrumental activities of daily living and 10 pounds or more unintended weight loss in the year before baseline clinical covariates include hypertension cardiovascular disease prevalent heart disease peripheral vascular disease or cerebrovascular disease maximum thickness of the internal carotid artery depression cesd score serum albumin serum cholesterol and serum creatinine these measures are explained in more detail elsewhere 21 22 23 24 we excluded 697 current smokers and 313 others with incomplete covariate data leaving 4878 persons on whom this analysis is based analysis all analyses were performed separately for men and women we calculated two sets of adjusted values as follows we regressed yol and yhl first on age age squared race and smoking history former or never and second on all of the covariates listed above we calculated adjusted yol as a persons observed yol minus predicted yol from the regression plus the mean yol 652 years for women or 606 for men that is a persons adjusted yol is his residual from the regression plus the grand mean the mean of this new variable for a group of subjects is the adjusted mean yol for that group adjusted yhl was calculated in a similar manner we calculated two sets of adjusted variables because of the possibility of overadjustment controlling inappropriately for factors such as diabetes which may have been causally affected by the persons weight we plotted mean adjusted yol and yhl against bmi and tested for difference among bmi groups using confidence intervals or analysis of variance finally we calculated the effect size for each measure comparing each bmi subgroup to the normal group the effect size is the difference in mean yol or yhl in two groups divided by their common standard deviation since the sample size required to detect an effect of this magnitude is proportional to the inverse of the squared effect size large effect sizes are desirable results table 1shows the distribution of key variables by sex and race mean age at baseline was 731 and about two thirds of the men and a third of the women were former smokers black women had a higher mean bmi and higher percent obese bmi 30 than the other three groups black men were most likely to have unintentionally lost more than 10 pounds in the past year white women were least likely about 78 of the subjects were healthy at baseline declining to 57 at the end of 7 years 20 had died data not shown of the 22 who were unhealthy fair or poor at baseline about 24 were healthy 7 years later there was thus substantial change in evgfp over time in both directions table 1shows the mean yol and yhl calculated from evgfp in the first seven years of the study adjusted to age 73 for example black women averaged 63 yol but only 42 yhl of a maximum possible 7 we calculated some additional descriptive statistics shown in the final two lines years of unhealthy life yol minus yhl and years lost to death 7 minus yol white women had the most yhl and black men the fewest black women had the most years of unhealthy life and white men the fewest black men lost the most years to death 13 out of 7 while white women lost only 04 years for blacks about 68 of their yol were healthy yhlyol not shown for whites about 75 were healthy among whites the gender differences in table 1were statistically significant p 05 except for bmi and unintended weight loss among blacks gender differences were significant except for 10 pounds unintended weight loss and weight loss since age 50 among males there were significant differences between black and white for bmi unintended weight loss yol yhl years of unhealthy life and years lost to death whites in the sample had higher income and education data not shown after adjusting for income and education as well as age and former smoking the difference in bmi was no longer statistically significant among females blacks and whites differed significantly on bmi bmi30 weight loss since age 50 yol yhl years of unhealthy life and years lost to death after adjustment for income and education the difference in weight loss since age 50 was no longer significant blacks had significantly lower yol and yhl than whites after adjustment for age but the difference disappeared after adjustment for the entire set of healthrelated baseline covariates analyses not shown we next examined the relationship of bmi to yol and yhl table 2presents the mean values of yol and yhl adjusted for age race and previous smoking columns 1 and 3 and also adjusted for the entire set of covariates columns 2 and 4 for example yol for women adjusted for age race and smoking averaged 60 years for women with a baseline bmi below 185 but averaged 66 years for women with a bmi from 25 to 299 the second column which shows results adjusted for all covariates is not very different the only discrepancy is for men with bmi 185 a category containing only 14 men adjustment for extensive covariates also made little difference for yhl columns 3 and 4 subsequent analyses are adjusted only for age race and former smoking as mentioned above the group with bmi from 185 to 20 would be considered normal by the nhlbi guidelines but had lower yol and yhl than those with 20249 in all comparisons for this reason and to increase sample size for those with low bmi we combined the two lower categories defining underweight as a bmi under 20 figure 1is a plot of adjusted yol and yhl by sex and bmi for each bmi category the mean and its 95 confidence interval are plotted categories whose confidence intervals do not overlap or overlap only slightly are significantly different the bars are slightly offset to permit all error bars to be seen yol for women the uppermost curve on figure 1 averaged about 65 out of 7 years and showed no evident association between bmi and yol for bmi above 20 underweight women averaged about 25 fewer yol than other women p 05 compared with normal group underweight men also had lower yol but this group was not significantly different from the normal group in part because of low sample size men classified as normal overweight or obese all had about the same yol the lowermost two lines in figure 1show mean yhl for women and men women who were normal or overweight averaged about 49 yhl the yhl for underweight or obese women was about 45 years which was significantly lower than the normal group the relationship of bmi to yhl for men is similar but differences among bmi groups were not statistically significant yhl was significantly higher for women than for men in the normal and overweight groups but the sexes had similar yhl in the underweight and obese groups we next present the effect size for comparing each group to the normal bmi group the effect sizes are shown in table 3 with the significance results of the associated ttests for the differences in means of the two groups being compared for example underweight women averaged 450 yhl compared to 492 for normal women and the common standard deviation was 144 the effect size is thus 492450144 29 the two groups had significantly different yhl implying that the effect size is also significantly greater than zero a clinical trial of a treatment to help underweight women achieve normal weight presumably by addressing the underlying cause could be expected to have 80 power with n 19684 229 2 about 93 women per treatment arm if 7year yhl were the outcome measure the biggest effect sizes are in the first row comparing underweight to normal yhl and yol have similar effect sizes for women and are significantly different from zero the effect sizes are not significantly different from zero for men in part because there were only 42 men in the underweight category the effect size comparing overweight to normal yielded small nonsignificant effect sizes with inconsistent signs suggesting extremely large sample sizes would be needed for comparing obese to normal only yhl for women showed a large and significant effect size thus an intervention to improve the health of underweight women to that of their normal weight peers could be performed using either yhl or yol as the outcome variable trials to make obese women comparable to normal women could be evaluated using yhl but not yol trials to improve the health of the other groups to that of the normals would probably be fruitless since there is no evidence that being overweight for men or women or obese for men affects yol or yhl as mentioned above we repeated these analyses excluding the persons with partially estimated data and using two different ways of coding yhl the only substantive change was that some of the differences between blacks and whites shown in table 1were no longer statistically significant due to a smaller sample size discussion optimal weight and overweight recent studies have defined obesity without reference to age 6 13 30 andres et al proposed a desirable bmi of 2430 for persons aged 60 to 69 8 allison et al 31 proposed 2730 for older men and 3035 for older women in figure 1 the overweight as opposed to the obese are no different from those of normal weight suggesting that these two categories could be combined for older adults since future improvements in life expectancy may be limited 32 the greatest advances may be made by improving peoples yhl this suggests that the development of future guidelines should take yhl or other measures of quality of life into account implications for clinical trials based on these findings trials to address obesity in older women could be efficient if yhl but not yol was the outcome measure that is women who changed from being obese to being normal would likely show changes in yhl but not yol clinical trials of weight modification interventions for older adults who were merely overweight would appear to be fruitless since the interventions would probably not have a direct effect on either yol or yhl weight or weight change are sometimes used as the outcome in evaluations of interventions such as diet or exercise programs the fact that weight is not associated in a consistent way with health suggests that such evaluations should be considered critically when older adults are the subjects this is particularly important in the light of recent findings which found that interventions such as weightloss drugs may be harmful 33 34 for older adults the risks associated with higher weight are especially unclear and the optimal outcome for a trial of weight loss in older adults requires specific attention to improved health and mortality interestingly the strongest health relationships were found for underweight older adults clinical trials whose objective was to make the underweight as healthy as their normalweight peers presumably by addressing the underlying conditions that caused the low weight could be performed efficiently using either yol or yhl as the outcome measure both yol and yhl would be clinically significant in this patient group potential limitations chs participants were somewhat healthier than the average older adult however adjustment for detailed covariates made little difference in the findings we estimated the last four years of health data for about 10 of the sample but results with and without this group were similar analysis of mean yol instead of the more traditional survival analysis survival analysis was appropriate here since virtually no persons were lost to followup biases caused by overadjustment are probably not large since the findings were not sensitive to the number of variables adjusted for these results are for a 7year followup the relative superiority of yhl to yol would probably hold in trials with shorter followup the effect sizes in table 3might also be appropriate in shorter trials since lengthy trials often add little information 10 evgfp on which yhl was based might have missed some effects of obesity on risk factors for future health a person who is depressed because of a poor selfimage related to obesity or who has osteoarthritis related to obesity and limits to activities to successfully avoid pain would surely have worse evgfp than others based on results from many studies however health measures designed specifically to measure those conditions might be more sensitive to change in weight than evgfp if yhl were based on such measures the superiority of yhl to yol would likely be even greater than that shown here these more sensitive measures might also have detected differences between the overweight and normal weight persons but we think this is unlikely given the absence of any differences in evgfp conclusion recommendations for desirable weight have been criticized for emphasizing mortality rather than health we found associations between yhl and obesity that were not present in the mortality analysis suggesting that yhl may be a more sensitive measure of the burden of obesity in older adults especially for women future efforts to determine desirable weight guidelines should include measures of yhl using either yol or yhl however we found no excess risk for older adults who would be classified as overweight by the nhlbi guidelines this suggests using yhl as the outcome measure in clinical trials involving obese or underweight older adults

 the problem three published 1 2 3 and one recently presented 4 randomized placebocontrolled clinical trial have unequivocally demonstrated that 3hydroxy3methylgluatryl coenzyme a hmg coa reductase inhibitors statins reduce the morbidity and mortality associated with coronary disease these trials found that when compared with placebo statins significantly reduced the incidence of death myocardial infarction unstable angina percutaneous and surgical coronary revascularization and stroke in persons with stable coronary disease because patients who had experienced an acute coronary syndrome within three to six months of enrollment were excluded these trials did not assess the effect of lipidlowering therapy on adverse cardiovascular events in those with recently unstable coronary disease whether lipidlowering therapy would provide incremental benefit if initiated immediately following an acute coronary syndrome is an important issue as the risk of a recurrent adverse cardiac events is much greater in patients with unstable coronary disease than in the stable setting the myocardial ischemia reduction with aggressive cholesterol lowering miracl trial set out to answer this question the answer miracl enrolled 3086 patients within 2496 hours mean 63 hours of admission for unstable angina or a nonqwave myocardial infarction and randomized them to 16 weeks of atorvastatin 80 mg or placebo once daily 5 the major exclusion criteria were total cholesterol level greater than 270 mgdl qwave myocardial infarction on admission or during the previous month and coronary revascularization in the months before admission during the index hospitalization or anticipated following hospital discharge the primary efficacy endpoint was a composite of death nonfatal myocardial infarction resuscitated sudden cardiac death or emergent rehospitalization for worsening symptomatic myocardial ischemia secondary endpoints included stroke worsening heart failure need for coronary revascularization and change in lipid levels throughout the study on average patients were 65 years of age approximately 65 were men 86 caucasian and the mean baseline low density lipoprotein ldl cholesterol level was 124 mgdl atorvastatin treatment was associated with a 26 absolute reduction in the risk of the primary endpoint 148 vs 174 rr relative risk rr 084 95 confidence interval ci 070100 p 0048 this reduction was primarily driven by the 22 absolute reduction in incidence of emergent rehospitalization for symptomatic myocardial ischemia 62 vs 84 rr 074 95 ci 057095 p 002 the risk of death nonfatal myocardial infarction and resuscitated sudden cardiac death were each no different between the two groups while there were no significant differences in the incidence of worsening heart failure or need for coronary revascularization atorvastatin did reduce the incidence of fatal or nonfatal stroke by 08 08 vs 16 rr 050 95 ci 026099 p 0045 atorvastatin also significantly reduced total and ldl cholesterol and triglyceride levels but did not significantly change high density lipoprotein hdl cholesterol by 16 weeks by 16 weeks the adjusted mean ldl cholesterol decreased to 72 mgdl in atorvastatintreated patients but increased to 135 mgdl among placebotreated patients no serious adverse events occurred as the result of treatment with atorvastatin although reversible liver transaminase elevation more than three times the upper limit of normal occurred in 25 of atorvastatintreated versus 06 of placebotreated patients p 0001 the miraculous the efficacy and safety findings from miracl were unique for a number of reasons although lipidlowering therapy was associated with a significantly lower mortality when initiated early after an acute coronary syndrome in two large observational studies 6 7 miracl was the first randomized trial to suggest that statins confer clinical benefits in this setting it was also the first trial to identify a shortterm ie within 16 weeks clinical benefit from statin therapy in previous secondary prevention trials the benefit of statin therapy was not evident for one to two years and while clinical trial safety endpoints may be considered less glamorous miracls most important contribution may have been that highdose statin therapy was not associated with serious harm despite its use in the unstable setting earlier secondary prevention statin trials had excluded patients with unstable coronary syndromes largely out of theoretical concern that statinmediated reductions in vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation might destabilize healing plaque that no harm resulted from this aggressive treatment strategy should allay theoretical fears and by doing so remove a major obstacle to the inpatient initiation of lipidlowing therapy after coronary events the not so miraculous despite these unique and important findings there were a number of inherent study limitations worth noting first and foremost the possibility of a null treatment effect cannot be ignored given the wide confidence intervals and hence marginally significant p value of 0048 for the effect of atorvastatin on the primary efficacy endpoint furthermore while the number of patients lost to follow up was small if adverse events had occurred in those treated with atorvastatin n 3 but not placebo n 8 the overall trial results may have been neutral rather than positive the types of events prevented in miracl are also worth noting while rehospitalization for recurrent myocardial ischemia is an important determinant of quality of life and health care costs other important endpoints were not significantly affected eg death myocardial infarction resuscitated sudden cardiac death worsening heart failure need for coronary revascularization etc the question of whether statins can prevent these and other adverse events when initiated soon after an acute coronary syndrome will require further study the short duration of followup is also particularly troubling while it is impressive that a clinical benefit was realized after only 16 weeks of statin therapy the increased risk of adverse clinical events persists throughout the year following an acute coronary syndrome without longer clinical follow up it is not possible to assess the intermediateterm effect if any of atorvastatin on hard endpoints such as death or myocardial infarction to do so would be critical in light of the lack of effect on these important endpoints at 16 weeks unfortunately no late clinical follow up is planned there were also a number of limitations that may have hampered the studys generalizability first patients who underwent recent revascularization or in whom it was planned were excluded specifically patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty ptca or coronary artery bypass graft cabg surgery within the previous three or six months respectively were not eligible for inclusion the investigators reasoned that recurrent ischemic events in this population were likely to result from restenosis or bypass graft closure and that statins would be less likely to affect these processes 8 nevertheless a number of trials have established the benefits of statin therapy early after coronary revascularization 9 10 11 furthermore a number of recent trials have suggested that higher risk patients with nonst elevation acute coronary syndromes fair better when an early invasive strategy is applied 12 13 14 and it is not uncommon for patients to be treated in this fashion second patients with qwave myocardial infarction were not eligible for enrollment because it was felt that statins would not influence the development of important prognostic determinants such as left ventricular systolic dysfunction ventricular arrhythmias or mechanical complications 5 nevertheless patients who develop electrocardiographic qwaves represent a substantial proportion of all patients with myocardial infarction while their shortterm risk following hospital discharge is lower relative to those with a nonqwave myocardial infarction it is still much greater than in patients with stable coronary disease and the need for secondary prevention in this population is equally important third despite the high risk nature of enrolled patients ie electrocardiogram ecg changes andor other objective evidence of ischemia the rate of platelet glycoprotein iibiiia inhibitor utilization was quite low 11 such therapy appears to be cost effective 15 16 especially among high risk patients and is recommended under current american college of cardiologyamerican heart association guidelines 17 fourth it may not be possible to ascertain whether these findings apply to all patients with recent acute coronary syndromes regardless of baseline lipid levels the small difference in number of primary endpoint events between atorvastatin and placebo groups make it difficult to dissect the relationship between baseline lipid levels and treatment effect further consequently it remains uncertain whether one can extrapolate the miracl trial results to those who undergo coronary revascularization shortly before or after a coronary event who present with a qwave myocardial infarction who are treated with platelet glycoprotein iibiiia inhibitors or who have relatively low admission ldl cholesterol levels time to change current practice although miracl and the two aforementioned cohort studies suggest that lipidlowering agents exert shortterm clinical benefits when initiated soon after an acute coronary syndrome this remains an open question even if these findings are not confirmed after further study one could still make a compelling argument that lipidlowering therapy barring contraindications should be initiated early and universally in patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome first the longterm safety and effectiveness of statins for the secondary prevention of stable coronary disease is wellestablished 1 2 3 second as evidenced by miracl these agents are safe when initiated at the time of hospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome third the inhospital initiation of lipidlowering therapy appears to promote greater longterm utilization of these agents 18 19 20 21 finally although lipid levels may be unreliable in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome excepting total hdl and ldlhdl cholesterol ratios 22 the overwhelming majority of patients with coronary disease will ultimately require both pharmacologic and nonpharmacologic lipidlowering interventions to attain recommended cholesterol targets 23 24 25 newer guidelines are even more stringent 26 furthermore data from the recently presented heart protection study suggest that clinical benefits may accrue independent of baseline cholesterol level 4 thus to withhold lipidlowering therapy from patients who present with an acute coronary syndrome would be to accept the status quo and to date our efforts at cholesterol lowering in the secondary prevention setting have been dismal 27 28 more miracles ahead the ascertainment and quantification of any incremental benefit conferred by statin therapy initiated early after an acute coronary syndrome will require confirmation there is currently only one ongoing randomized placebocontrolled trial of early versus delayed statin therapy in this setting a2z aggrastat to zocor merck 29 the a2z study is evaluating the efficacy of early treatment with simvastatin in 4500 patients following an episode of unstable angina or a nonq wave myocardial infarction in the first four months patients will be randomized to simvastatin 40 mg daily or placebo thereafter those patients treated with simvastatin in the first phase will receive 80 mg of simvastatin daily and those treated with placebo 40 mg of simvastatin daily the primary composite endpoint is the occurrence of cardiovascular death nonfatal myocardial infarction or rehospitalization for an acute coronary syndrome acs at one year if a2z demonstrates significant reductions in the incidence of adverse events during the first four months it would suggest an incremental clinical benefit from initiating these agents early after an acute coronary syndrome if benefits accrue but do so later during follow up it would be difficult to discriminate between the effects of more aggressive vs earlier lipid lowering therapy the pravastatin or atorvastatin evaluation and infection therapy prove it trial is looking at 4000 patients within 10 days of an acute coronary syndrome and randomizing them to either pravastatin 40 mg or atorvastatin 80 mg daily 29 patients will be observed over at least 15 years for the occurrence of myocardial infarction or other cardiovascular events unlike miracl and the a2z trials this study will not assess the efficacy of early statin therapy after an acute coronary syndrome rather it will examine the role of more vs less aggressive lipidlowering in this setting in 2002 many would consider it unethical to withhold statins from patients with established coronary disease this makes it unlikely that additional placebocontrolled trials will be carried out in this area future secondary prevention studies should look at patients with stable or unstable disease and will need to address the comparative efficacy of different statins or newer agents assess the incremental benefit of combination therapy 30 and determine whether there is a serum cholesterol floor below which reductions are

 background ectonucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolases entpdases formerly called ectoatpases hydrolyze nucleotides in the presence of divalent cations and are insensitive to inhibitors of ptype ftype and vtype atpases 1 three isoforms that differ in the ratio of atpaseadpase activity are present on the cell surface 2 entpdase1 with a ratio of 1 entpdase2 with a ratio of 10 and entpdase3 with a ratio of 35 ntpdases are important in many physiological processes like cell motility adhesion nonsynaptic information transfer secretion regulation of hemostasis and ectokinases 1 understanding the enzymatic mechanisms of the ntpdases will help description of their physiological functions and development of strategies to regulate the functions of the enzymes the catalytic mechanism of ntpdases is not known even though some basic facts of the catalysis have been established ntpdases do not form phosphorylated intermediates during catalysis a conclusion also supported by lack of vanadate sensitivity and pi product inhibition 3 4 5 6 the catalytic reaction appears to be irreversible and no partial reactions have been observed 7 8 divalent cations like ca 2or mg 2are required for activity and maximal activity is reached when the concentrations of substrates and divalent cations are equal 1 the specific activities of ntpdases vary over a broad range from ten thousand units for potato apyrase to less than one hundred units for chicken gizzard ectoatpase 9 10 sequence comparisons indicate that most of ntpdases contain five highly conserved regions apyrase conserved region acr1 acr5 9 11 however the catalytic sites have not been identified although acr1 and acr4 have been implicated in and phosphate binding respectively 9 entpdase1 is also called cd39 as it was first described as an antigen present on activated b and t lymphocytes residues of acr1 to acr5 of cd39 have been mutated to study the involvement of the acr regions in catalysis e174 in acr3 and s218 in acr4 are required for catalytic function 12 substitution of h59 in acr1 converted cd39 into an adpase in a quaternary structure dependent manner 13 mutation of w187a in acr3 affected cd39 folding and translocation while mutation of w459a in acr5 increased atpase activity but diminished adpase activity 14 mutations of d62 and g64 of acr1 and d219 and g221 of acr4 demonstrated that the nucleotide phosphate binding domains of ntpdases are similar to those present in the actinheat shock proteinsugar kinase superfamily 15 these results suggest that the conserved residues of the acr1 to 5 regions are involved in the catalytic mechanism of cd39 the catalytic activity of cd39 is dependent on the presence of divalent cations since the interactions of ca 2and mg 2with proteins are difficult to study due to the lack of spectroscopic properties vanadyl v ivo 2has been used as a probe of the ligands that compose mg 2 ca 2 and mn 2binding sites of several proteins including carboxypeptidase 16 sadenosylmethionine synthetase 17 18 pyruvate kinase 19 20 and f 1 atpase 21 22 this cation specifically binds to divalent cation binding sites of several enzymes and in many cases serves as a functional cofactor 23 vanadyl has one axial and four equatorial coordination sites relative to the axis of the doublebounded oxygen an arrangement that is similar to that for ca 2and mg 2 as it is known that the a and g tensors derived from the epr spectrum of bound vo 2are a direct measure of the nature of the equatorial metal ligands 24 binding of vo 2to cd39 could provide details about the catalytic mechanism of cd39 recently we reported that a recombinant soluble cd39 capable of hydrolyzing both atp and adp was expressed and purified from insect cells 25 only one nucleotidebinding site was identified on the purified soluble cd39 in the presence of ca 2when nonhydrolysable nucleotide analogs were used in this report we characterized the signals that were obtained from bound vo 2when atp or adp was present at the catalytic site of the purified soluble cd39 the possible metal ligands for vo 2at the catalytic site are proposed and the catalytic mechanism is discussed results nucleotidase activity of purified soluble cd39 with vo 2as cofactor the ability of purified soluble cd39 to hydrolyze vo 2atp is shown in figure 1 soluble cd39 did not hydrolyze either atp or adp in the absence of vo 2fig 1a when vo 2was mixed with atp at a ratio of 11 the concentrations of both adp and amp increased and atp decreased as the incubation time was prolonged fig 1b the atpase activity of scd39 with vo 2was about 25 of that with ca 2as a cofactor vanadyl is unstable in aqueous solution at ph70 in the absence of chelator and will precipitate out of solution as vooh 2 n the rate of precipitation depends on the abundance and affinity of the chelator this means that the actual vo 2concentration was lower than 05 mm this result indicates that vo 2can functionally substitute for ca 2as cofactor for scd39 nucleotidase activity characterization of bound vo 2adpnp by cwepr the parallel features of cwepr spectrum of bound vo 2in the presence of adpnp an atp analog are shown in figure 2a this spectrum shows 51v hyperfine splitting and the center of the parallel transitions from molecules with the vo bond oriented along the magnetic field a g which are strong enough to tell the nature of vo 2equatorial ligands 22 of the eight transitions that result from the parallel oriented molecules the 72 52 32 52 and 72 transitions shown in the figures from left to right respectively do not overlap with perpendicular transitions the 51v hyperfine splitting spectra from molecules with vo bond perpendicular to the magnetic field a are much smaller and not shown here 21 the intensity of 52 peak is used as direct measurement of the amount of bound vo 2 since this peak is the most intense peak in the epr spectrum that contains contribution only from a but not a 21 26 in this study the intensities of each bound vo 2epr feature were normalized to 1 mg of protein vo 2bound as the vo 2amppnp complex to scd39 produced a strong spectrum characterized by a of 50425 mhz and g of 19410 fig 2b called species t table 1 the best fit of epr species t to eq 1 is one equatorial nitrogen from an amino group and three equatorial oxygen ligands from carboxyl or phosphate groups table 2 this result is consistent with amppnp binding strongly to a single site on scd39 in the presence of metal 25 characterization of epr species from vo 2ampcp bound to scd39 figure 3ashows the parallel features of the epr spectrum of scd39 bound vo 2ampcp two sets of parallel transitions were observed and the derived a and g values are listed in table 1 one set had a of 52178 mhz and g of 1937 which is defined as species d1 fig 3b the other set displayed a of 49001 mhz and g of 19435 which is called species d2 fig 3c the intensity of species d1 accounted for 114 of species t from bound vo 2amppnp and the intensity of d2 accounted for 71 of species t the intensity ratio of species d1 over d2 was 16 in order to distinguish species d1 from d2 the sample with vo 2ampcp bound to scd39 was thawed and incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes and the vo 2epr spectrum was collected again as shown in figure 4aand 4b either a or g values for both species d1 and d2 were changed the intensity of species d1 was not changed as it accounted for 121 of the intensity of species t of the bound vo 2amppnp however the intensity of species d2 was decreased dramatically and it accounted for only 01 of the intensity of species t the intensity ratio of d1 over d2 increased about 75 fold to become 120 there are two sets of equatorial ligands that can fit well the epr species d1 according to eq 1 table 2 one set includes two equatorial oxygen from two water molecules one equatorial oxygen from a carboxyl group or phosphate and one equatorial nitrogen from an amino group the other set contains one equatorial oxygen from water and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate the best fit for the epr species d2 to eq 1 is one equatorial oxygen from a hydroxyl group and three equatorial oxygens from carboxyl groups or phosphate epr characteristics of scd39 bound vo 2atp in order to capture the bound vo 2epr signal before the enzyme completely turned over scd39 and vo 2atp were mixed on ice immediately transferred into the epr tube and frozen the entire process took about 15 seconds the parallel portion of the collected vo 2epr spectrum is shown in figure 5a vo 2atp complex bound to scd39 produced an epr spectrum with a of 4895 mhz and g of 19455 which corresponded to species d2 fig 5b the signal intensity from the bound vo 2nucleotide complex accounted only for 75 of that of species t from bound nonhydrolysable vo 2adpnp complex the same sample made from mixing vo 2atp and scd39 was incubated at room temperature for 30 minutes then the vo 2epr spectrum was generated as shown in figures 4cand 4d the epr parameters derived from this vo 2epr spectrum were 4895 mhz for a and 19455 for g respectively which is consistent with species d2 however the signal intensity decreased about 375 fold compared to that obtained before room temperature incubation free vo 2binding to scd39 characterized by cdepr like other metals ca 2and mg 2 free vo 2inhibited the nucleotidase activities of scd39 at high concentration data not shown vo 2in the absence of any nucleotides was added to scd39 at 11 molar ratio the parallel transitions of bound vo 2epr spectrum are shown in figure 6 the features derived from the vo 2epr spectrum were 486 mhz for a and 1946 for g which was designed as species v fig 6b the signal intensity of bound vo 2accounted for 203 of that from the bound vo 2adpnp complex the best fit of equatorial ligands for species v according to eq 1 is two equatorial oxygen from hydroxyl groups and another two equatorial oxygen from two water molecules discussion vanadyl has been used to estimate the types of groups that serve as metalligands in f 1 atpase and other enzymes 16 18 19 21 because the g and a tensors of the 51v hyperfine couplings are approximately a linear combination of tensors from each type of group that contributes an equatorial ligand 24 27 by studying the epr spectra of bound vo 2in the presence of different nucleotides we show that the interaction of soluble cd39 with atp is different from that with adp it is not surprising that vo 2can functionally replace ca 2in the hydrolysis of both atp and adp by soluble cd39 although the enzymatic activity is about 25 of that with ca 2as the cofactor since f 1 atpase also hydrolyzes atp at a decreased rate when vo 2replaces mg 2 21 the epr features of vo 2are able to reveal some details about how cd39 hydrolyzes atp and adp a single epr feature species t was observed when adpnp a nonhydrolyzable analog of atp complexed with vo 2was bound to scd39 which is consistent with the presence of only one nucleotide binding site 25 the g and a tensors derived from species t are 19410 and 50425 mhz respectively which can be fitted best with one amino group and three groups combined from carboxyl and phosphate groups as the equatorial ligands of the bound vo 2on scd39 in accordance with metalatp complex coordination on other enzymes that hydrolyze atp like f 1 atpase 22 28 the and phosphate of atp most likely bind to vo 2while the third carboxyl group is contributed by a sidechain of aspartate or glutamate of scd39 it is not unusual for the amino group of lysine to coordinate with metals in enzymes it has been reported that the amino group serves as one of vo 2equatorial ligands in cf 1 atpase 21 pyruvate kinase 19 20 adomet synthetase 17 18 and carboxypeptidase 16 thus one amino group from lysine one carboxyl group from aspartate or glutamate and two oxygens from the phosphates of adpnp serve as the equatorial ligands of scd39 bound vo 2in the presence of adpnp in the presence of ampcp bound vo 2produced two epr features species d1 and species d2 that are separated by about 30 mhz as we have reported that scd39 releases intermediate adp before adp is further cleaved during atp hydrolysis 25 scd39 probably has two conformations that bind metaladp complexes one is the conformation that releases the adp intermediate and another that recruits intermediate adp back to the enzyme for further hydrolysis to amp however intact cd39 does not release intermediate adp during atp hydrolysis suggesting that there is only one adp binding site on each cd39 monomer in the intact protein 2 25 the two epr species observed with vo 2ampcp probably correspond to the two different conformations of bound adp at the same catalytic site on scd39 the signal intensity of the bound vo 2ampcp epr spectrum indicates that species d1 is dominant over species d2 in order to further assign species d1 and d2 to the two different conformations two experiments were done fig 5 incubation of scd39 with vo 2ampcp at room temperature resulted in a dramatic decrease of the intensity of species d2 while the signal intensity of species d1 remained unchanged these data indicate that vo 2ampcp was released from the conformation corresponding to species d2 however the conformation corresponding to species d1 still had bound vo 2ampcp more evidence for two conformations of the enzyme was obtained from the epr spectra of bound vo 2atp no species t was found presumably because atp was converted to adp before the sample was frozen only species d2 was observed and its intensity decreased as the incubation time was prolonged we suggest that species d2 corresponds to the conformation that releases adp as an intermediate product and species d1 corresponds to the conformation that binds adp as a substrate the lower signal intensities of species d1 and d2 compared to that of species t suggest that the affinity of scd39 for adp or its analog ampcp is lower than that for the atp analog adpnp which is consistent with the result that only atp analogs were detected on scd39 25 the calculated g and a values that best matched the experimental values for species d2 suggest that one hydroxyl group and three oxygens derived from carboxyl groups and phosphates are the equatorial ligands of bound vo 2adp since the conformation corresponding to species d2 is found in the presence of atp and is likely to be the conformation that releases bound vo 2adp it is likely that the vo 2ligands are one phosphate and two carboxyl groups 25 when adp is the substrate and generates species d1 one water molecule and a combination of three groups between carboxyl groups and phosphates serve as the equatorial ligands of bound vo 2on scd39 the probable combination of carboxyl groups and phosphates for species d1 is one carboxyl group and two phosphates since vo 2complexes adp through two phosphates before vo 2adp is bound to the enzyme the site directed mutagenesis studies on cd39 and other members of the cd39 family give some hints about the possible residues that serve as metal ligands at the catalytic site of scd39 the changes of d62 on acr1 e174 on acr3 d213 d219 in hb6 and s218 on acr4 dramatically decrease both atpase and adpase activities of cd39 12 15 figure 7summarizes the possible coordination of ca 2from the data of species t species d1 and species d2 in the different situations of scd39 catalysis the catalytic base attack results in cleavage of the phosphate of atp and one carboxyl group replaces the phosphate as a metal ligand from species t to species d2 which is accompanied by a swap of an amino group with a hydroxyl group s218 this hydroxyl group s218 probably interacts with the water molecule through hydrogen bond in the conformation corresponding to species d1 to hydrolyze adp the constant carboxyl group that appears in all conformations of scd39 hydrolysis is likely contributed by d213 since it is close to s218 the results presented here also provide an explanation to the free metal inhibition of cd39 catalytic activity free vo 2binds to scd39 through two hydroxyl groups and two water molecules that are hydrogen bonded to other residues of scd39 once free vo 2occupies the catalytic site the enzyme has to either release the metal or correct the conformation before the substrates are recruited properly conclusions vo 2can functionally substitute for ca 2as a cofactor for scd39 four different epr spectra are obtained for vo 2bound in the presence of different nucleotides and in the absence of nucleotide the protein ligands for vo 2in the presence of atp are suggested to be carboxyl and amino groups while those in the presence of adp are probably carboxyl and hydroxyl groups the mechanism of scd catalysis is discussed these results will provide guides for further studies of the catalytic mechanism of ntpdases materials and methods

 background glutamate decarboxylase gad catalyzes the formation of the inhibitory neurotransmitter amino butyric acid gaba from glutamate in mammals the two isoforms of this enzyme gad67 and gad65 are expressed from two separate genes gad1 and gad2 respectively 1 2 3 gaba signaling plays several roles in neuronal development early in cns development gaba can modulate neuron progenitor proliferation as well as neuron migration survival and differentiation 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 in some classes of neural progenitors gaba stimulates these processes while in others it has an antagonistic activity for example recent work has demonstrated that gaba acts in the developing neocortex to stimulate the proliferation of progenitors in the ventricular zone while inhibiting the proliferation of progenitors in the subventricular zone 14 later during postnatal development normal gabaergic input is required for activitydependent plasticity in the visual cortex as shown in the gad2 knockout mouse 15 16 in addition to these functions in the developing cns gaba signaling is also required for the normal development of nonneural tissues targeted mutations of the gad1 gene lead to defective development of the secondary palate 17 18 the cleft palate phenotype of the gad1 mutants suggests the involvement of gabamediated signals in the normal development and differentiation of a structure derived from the oral epithelium and neural crest ectomesenchyme this conclusion is further supported by the similar cleft palate defect seen in mice with a deletion or targeted mutation in the 3 subunit of the gaba a receptor 19 20 21 22 this intriguing genetic evidence indicates a role for gabamediated signaling in the development of a nonneural structure the secondary palate the potential for this pathway to be involved in the early development of additional nonneural tissues has not yet been thoroughly explored 23 to address this question we surveyed gad1 transcript distribution in the noncns tissues of the embryo using a whole mount in situ hybridization approach we found that gad1 is indeed expressed in a number of different regions and tissues a notable feature of this expression pattern is that gad1 transcripts accumulate in the specialized ectodermal structures that are involved in the formation of the mystacial vibrissae and in limb outgrowth these specialized ectodermal tissues are known to be sources of developmental signals 24 25 26 in addition transcripts are expressed in the mesenchymal stem cell population of the tailbud and in the pharyngeal endoderm and mesenchyme the expression patterns show that gad1 is expressed in several noncns structures that are derived from each of the three germ layers of the embryo results the mouse gad1 gene is widely expressed in the embryonic central nervous system 27 to define additional sites of expression outside of the cns we analyzed the distribution of gad1 transcripts in e85 to e145 mouse embryos by whole mount in situ hybridization gad1 transcripts were not detected in e85 day embryos data not shown at e90 gad1 was readily detected in the tailbud figure 1a expression in the tail continued through e125 and was undetectable by e135 figure 1bcdand data not shown a period corresponding to secondary body axis formation in the mouse embryo 28 examination of sections from an e95 embryo revealed a high level of gad1 expression throughout the mesenchyme and neural epithelium in the caudal portion of the tailbud figure 1f no transcripts were detected in the surface ectoderm surrounding the tailbud mesenchyme figure 1f at more cranial levels within the tail expression was localized to paraxial mesoderm ventral neural tube notochord and cells of the dorsal hindgut figure 1e in the paraxial mesoderm the highest expression levels were also localized ventrally adjacent to the notochord figure 1e in the pharyngeal region of e95 embryos gad1 rna was detected in and around the second third and fourth pharyngeal pouches figure 2a sections through the third pouch confirmed the presence of gad1 expression in the pouch endoderm data not shown expression was particularly strong in the dorsal portion of this pouch figure 2b the additional diffuse staining appeared to be in the pharyngeal mesenchyme figure 2b the expression in the pharyngeal region was very transient transcripts were easily detected at e95 but only faintly at e90 and were not detectable by e105 in the limb buds gad1 rna was detected from e90 to e115 figure 3abcdefgh transcripts were initially expressed in the preapical ectodermal ridge preaer at e95 figure 3ab and by e105 were seen in the definitive aer of the forelimb figure 3d at e105 gad1 was expressed in a diffuse stripe in the forelimb figure 3d while in the hindlimb expression was only detected in the apical ectoderm figure 3e by e115 forelimb aer expression was fading and expression was seen in a diffuse stripe in the proximal forelimb and a diffuse crescent in the proximal hindlimb figure 3gh the earlier activation of gad1 in the forelimb reflects the normal temporal order of events in limb development sections indicate that the expression within the limb buds was in surface ectoderm and adjacent mesenchyme data not shown gad1 rna was not detected in the limbs by whole mount in situ hybridization after e115 a dynamic pattern of gad1 expression was detected in the developing vibrissae from e125 to e145 figure 4abcdefgh expression was first detected in the supraorbital infraorbital and postoral vibrissae and in the posterior vibrissae in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows figure 4ab nomenclature as in 29 gad1 rna was also detected in some of the posterior labial vibrissae at this stage expression was activated in a posterior to anterior towards the nose progression in the lateral nasal and maxillary rows reflecting the pattern of vibrissal development 29 by e135 gad1 expression was detected in the anterior lateral nasal and maxillary rows and was activated in the rhinal labial and submental vibrissae figure 4cd by e145 expression was strong in the labial submental and rhinal vibrissae figure 4ef sections of e125 whole mounts show that gad1 expression was localized to the epidermal placodes of the mystacial vibrissae figure 4gh and was maintained as the placodes begin to invaginate figure 4g control hybridizations using a sense strand gad1 probe were also performed embryos hybridized to the sense probe did not reveal any staining pattern at any of the stages tested e85 e145 sense strand hybridization results for e105 and e115 embryos are shown in figure 5 discussion the expression results reported here show that gad1 was activated in several tissues outside of the central nervous system during mouse development transcripts were not seen at e85 and were first detected at e90 it was surprising that this very early phase of gad1 expression was largely outside of the developing cns and was localized in the tail bud mesenchyme and in the preapical ectodermal ridge preaer of the forelimb bud as development proceeded gad1 was detected in pharyngeal endoderm and in the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae the data demonstrate that gad1 is expressed in several sites outside of the developing cns and in derivatives of all three germ layers we have also detected the expression of gad1lacz transgenes in the developing vibrissae and limbs supporting the novel and surprising in situ hybridization results we report here jj westmoreland and bgc unpublished results previous studies have shown that gad1 can be regulated at the posttranscriptional and translational level gad1 mrna translation or protein stability can be regulated in mature neurons by the level of gaba 30 31 during embryogenesis posttranscriptional regulation occurs by alternative splicing during embryonic development in rats and mice 32 33 this alternate embryonic transcript inserts a stop codon into the gad1 mrna and can produce the truncated proteins gad25 and gad44 from its 5 and 3 ends respectively the studies reported here used a probe that will detect the adult gad1 mrna that encodes gad67 as well as the embryonic alternatively spliced mrna that can encode gad25 and gad44 these additional mechanisms of gad1 regulation may control the production of gad proteins and the synthesis of gaba in the nonneural cell types detected in our study the whole mount in situ hybridization data reported here extends the results of a recently published section in situ hybridization study on e105e125 mouse embryos 27 our analysis showed that gad1 expression is first detectable earlier at e90 and revealed novel noncns sites of expression in the pharyngeal region vibrissae tail bud and limb bud the results of the previous study 27 together with the data reported herein provide a comprehensive picture of gad1 expression in the e90e125 mouse embryo previous studies have noted gad expression outside of the cns in adults gad1 and gad2 have been detected in a number of tissues including kidney testis oviduct pancreatic islets and adrenal cortex 34 35 36 37 previously reported sites of embryonic gad1 expression outside of the brain and spinal cord during rodent development include the lens fibers and the olfactory pit 38 39 in e105e125 mouse embryos gad1 is expressed in the olfactory and the lens placodes the anlagen of the olfactory pit and lens fibers 27 we also detected gad1 expression in these tissues please see figure 3aand data not shown expression of gad in the developing heart and blood vessels has also been reported 27 we detected weak staining in the heart and did not detect blood vessel expression perhaps due to the very low levels of expression in developing vasculature 27 our results document localized expression of gad1 at additional noncns sites in the mouse embryo suggesting a potential role for gaba signaling in the development of these structures our interest in the role of gaba signaling in developing tissues outside of the central nervous system stems from the cleft palate phenotype of the gad1 and the 3 gaba a receptor subunit mutants 17 18 19 21 22 the genetic data strongly suggest that gaba acts through gaba a receptors to modulate the development of this tissue although the data reported here do not explain the origin of the cleft palate phenotype they do indicate that gad1 is expressed in several additional noncns tissues in the mouse embryo it is particularly noteworthy that these include the aer of the limb buds and the ectodermal placodes of the vibrissae both are ectodermal structures known to be sources of developmental signals required for morphogenesis and patterning 24 25 26 40 it will be of interest to examine the expression pattern of gaba receptors in the mesenchyme adjacent to these ectodermal signaling centers expression of gaba receptor subunits in adjacent tissues would indicate that these receptors read the developmental signals mediated by gaba in these structures and tissues conclusions the mouse gene encoding the 67 kda isoform of glutamate decarboxylase gad1 is expressed in the tail bud mesenchyme vibrissal placodes pharyngeal arches and pouches and the apical ectodermal ridge aer mesenchyme and ectoderm of the limb buds in mouse embryos from e90e145 some of the gad1 expressing tissues vibrissal placodes aer are known sources of developmental signals other sites of expression correspond to stem cell populations that give rise to multiple differentiated tissues tail bud mesenchyme pharyngeal endoderm and mesenchyme the localized and dynamic expression pattern of gad1 suggests a wider role for gad and gaba in the development of nonneural tissues than was

 background primary sjgrens syndrome 1ss is a systemic autoimmune disorder characterized by dry eyes keratoconjunctivitis sicca dry mouth xerostomia as well as involvement of other exocrine glands while 1ss is typically considered an autoimmune exocrinopathy the immune destruction can often extend to affect nonexocrine organs around 25 of patients with 1ss can present with involvement of other organs such as the thyroid central nervous system lungs kidney and liver the association of liver disease and 1ss was suggested more than 40 years ago 1 while liver involvement in 1ss has been considered rare 2 only a few clinical studies specifically address this complication and evaluate the association of liver function tests abnormalities with the severity of 1ss 3 4 5 6 liver diseases associated with 1ss include primary biliary cirrhosis pbcautoimmune cholangitis 8 9 10 autoimmune hepatitis 5 6 viral hepatitis b and c 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 sclerosing cholangitis 22 and nodular regenerative hyperplasia 23 in addition chronic lymphocytic sialadenitis has been found in patients with different types of liver cirrhosis 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 we report the results of a review of cases undertaken to determine the prevalence of abnormal liver function tests lfts and liver disease in patients with 1ss referred to a tertiary care center and the association of abnormal lfts with other systemic features and autoimmunity markers of 1ss methods statistical analysis the statistical analysis included descriptive measures means standard deviations and ranges comparison of results of patients with and without liver disease was done using ttests of continuous variables and fishers exact test or x2 for categoric measures results of the 115 charts reviewed 73 cases 55 women and 18 men median age 53 fulfilled eecc for 1ss and were initially included for analysis of the 73 patients a 54 of them 40 patients have had a salivary gland biopsy performed in all these patients the biopsy confirmed the diagnosis of sjgrens syndrome all patients studied had objective evidence of 1ss including keratoconjunctivitis sicca positive labial salivary gland biopsy autoantibodies andor salivary gland hypofunction we excluded those patients without these objective criteria of 1ss and also those who did not fulfill eecc criteria the mean age at time of onset of disease was 45 205 years old and disease duration was 49 years 45 years mean range liver function tests had been determined in 59 patients 808 and abnormal liver function tests were found in 29 of the 59 patients 491 further analysis was then undertaken in those patients in whom lfts had been measured the clinical and laboratory characteristics of these patients are shown in tables 2and 3 for these ss patients studied abnormal lfts were more common than any other potential nonexocrine features of ss clinical evidence of liver disease defined in methods section was found in 12 patients 203 all of whom had abnormal liver function tests two deaths occurred in the population studied both attributed to liver failure an additional patient required a liver transplant in all cases the diagnosis of 1ss antedated the onset of liver disease or its diagnosis markers of viral hepatitis sought in 39 patients were found only in 4 two patients carried the surface antigen of hepatitis b virus and one had antibodies to hepatitis c virus in a liver biopsy of a patient who lacked serological markers for hepatitis viruses hepatitis b virus was detected by in situ hybridization risk factors for liver disease were identified in 40 of the patients with abnormal liver function tests and are described in table 4 no association with tobacco use was found only 5 patients had documented evidence of tobacco consumption we found no significant differences in risk factors for abnormal liver function tests among patients with or without hepatic involvement therefore in 60 of the patients with sub clinical or clinical evidence of liver disease no clear explanation for the abnormal lfts was found except for the association with 1ss the pattern of biochemical liver abnormalities was mainly hepatocellular defined as predominant increase of ast andor alt in comparison with ap andor bilirubins in 11 cases cholestatic defined as predominant increase in ap andor bilirubins compared with ast andor alt in 3 and mixed evidence of both cholestatic and hepatocellular damage in 8 cases abnormalities were persistent present on every occasion when measured more than once in 19 patients 655 of those with abnormal lfts intermittent presence of lft abnormalities was not found in all determinations in 9 31 and in one case 35 there was only one determination of liver function tests the pattern of liver enzyme abnormalities is shown in figure 1 none of the patients with abnormal liver function tests had clinical evidence of muscle involvement that could explain the high levels of aminotransferases activity of cpk or aldolase was not elevated when measured in 15 of the 29 patients with abnormal liver function tests antimitochondrial antibodies ama and antismooth muscle antibodies asma were sought in 5 patients with positive asma in 2 the association of abnormal liver function tests with other nonexocrine features of 1ss is shown in figure 2 patients with abnormal liver function tests were more likely to have lung kidney or hematological manifestations when compared to sjgrens patients without liver disease presence of other nonexocrine features of 1ss was not influenced by prevalence of liver diseases regarding laboratory test results patients with liver disease were more likely to have an elevated sedimentation rate at some point during the course of their disease a positive antiena antiro antirola andor antirnp was also associated with an increased prevalence of abnormal liver function tests figure 3 the sample was too small to determine whether a specific ena was associated with liver disease other markers of systemic inflammation or autoimmunity did not correlate with the presence or absence of lft abnormalities liver biopsies done in 8 patients disclosed postviral chronic active hepatitis 3 cryptogenic cirrhosis 2 and one case each of postviral cirrhosis alcoholic hepatitis and autoimmune hepatitis discussion in this group of sjgrens patients seen at a tertiary care center abnormal liver function tests were found to be a common nonexocrine feature of 1ss the prevalence of this association was found to be higher in our study than in other previous series 2 3 4 5 6 7 the true prevalence could be even higher since liver enzyme profiles were not done in all patients the prevalence suggested in previous reports ranges from 6 to 58 but the definition of hepatic disease varies from the unspecific eg hepatomegaly to well proven cases of liver disease 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 28 denko in 1960 reported that 12 of patients with ss had hepatosplenomegaly 29 other studies done in the 1960s also confirmed hepatomegaly in 1820 of patients with ss 30 31 in 1970 whaley reported liver disease in 6 of patients with ss and mentioned an association with antimitochondrial antibodies 2 in 1986 tsianos and coworkers described 22 ss patients with gastrointestinal complications called from a large cohort only two patients had liver disease each with chronic active hepatitis 4 other studies have reported variable prevalence 3 28 and different histopathological findings in liver biopsies ranging from cholestatic liver damage stage i primary biliary cirrhosis to chronic active hepatitis due to hepatitis c virus in our study liver disease was associated with other nonexocrine manifestations of 1ss specifically those affecting lung kidney and blood cells those patients with serological evidence of systemic inflammation as shown by an elevated sedimentation rate were more likely to have liver test abnormalities also the presence of a positive antiena correlated positively with hepatic disease an association of ena response with liver disease has been described in children with autoimmune hepatitis where antienapositive patients demonstrated more severe liver test abnormalities than those who were antienanegative 32 in another study a 15 of patients with various chronic liver diseases were found to be antirnp positive 33 with etiopathogenesis of 1ss still an open question 34 a possible role of hepatitis c virus hcv has drawn attention recent studies have mentioned hcv incidence in patients with 1ss ranging from 1419 11 12 16 18 21 phenotypic characterization of the minor salivary glands with immunohistochemistry in patients with hepatitis c virus infection andor 1ss has given conflicting results 14 15 some reports mention that the salivary gland findings are strikingly similar in patients with liver disease associated with hcv infection than in those with 1ss 12 while others mention distinctive differences between both groups regarding focus score expression of surface markers in lymphocytes infiltrating the salivary glands and in epithelial cells as well as differences in the degree of inflammation 14 15 transgenic mice models that carry the hcv envelope genes develop an exocrinopathy affecting salivary and lachrymal glands 19 expression of autoimmunity markers also tends to differ between hcvinfection and 1ss positive enas are rarely seen in hcvpatients also in most cases sicca symptoms are not present in individuals with hcv as compared with the 1ss population although the prevalence of viral hepatitis markers in our group of patients with liver disease was very low and did not account for most of the cases with abnormal liver function tests these markers were not sought in a small percentage of these patients it is important to note that hcv appears to account for a subgroup of patients with exocrine complaints in which half the cases might meet the definition for ss according to european and manthorpe criteria however this subgroup is characterized by the absence of clinical manifestations observed in 1ss and the absence of antiro and antila 35 an aberrant interaction between lymphocytes and different epithelial tissues has been proposed as a mechanism for the damage seen in different organs in 1 ss 36 since it has been suggested that the target tissue involved in the autoimmune histopathologic lesions of 1ss might be the epithelium 37 it is interesting that the findings in our study point to the association of liver disease with pulmonary and renal abnormalities all which are characterized by epithelial damage 38 39 epithelial cells have been proposed to be active participants rather than passive targets in the chronic immune response in 1ss but further studies are needed to establish the role of liver epithelial cells in the pathogenesis of hepatic damage in this disease including the analysis of hla expression and cytokine secretion pattern in these cells the coexistence of liver disease and the presence of circulating amas in sjgrens patients sera has been pointed as an indicator that liver pathology might be autoimmune and similar to that of primary biliary cirrhosis 4 7 8 10 in previous studies a pericholangial lymphocytic infiltration similar to that found in stage i of primary biliary cirrhosis has been reported in 1ss with abnormal liver function tests or positivity for ama 4 7 in our review of cases we found predominance in hepatocellular liver damage rather than cholestatic disease which would argue against a pbctype of liver damage other authors had proposed that ss associated with pbc should be considered a form of secondary ss that resembles more the sicca complex with exocrine features seen in patients with rheumatoid arthritis 40 41 limitations of the study come primarily from being a retrospective analysis since the patients were studied in a tertiary care referral center the severity of the disease and the prevalence of the manifestations might be different from the general 1ss population furthermore in many cases sjgrens syndrome diagnosis had been sought because of otherwise unexplained nonexocrine features while we could not find an association between use of nsaids or other medications and prevalence of liver function tests abnormalities the study design did not allow us to exclude the possibility of overthecounter otc medication use that could have affected lfts measurement drug toxicity is certainly an important factor to be considered however given that most patients had persistent rather than intermittent abnormalities of lfts and that the use of hepatotoxic drugs was not elicited in the majority of patients with liver abnormalities a toxic effect of medications could not be established conclusions based on the results of this study we consider that an evaluation for clinical and serological evidence of liver disease should be done in every patient with 1ss particularly if there is evidence of other nonexocrine complications or serological evidence of systemic inflammation although no other diagnosis explaining liver disease may be found the disorders for which treatment might be beneficial eg immunosuppressants for autoimmune hepatitis interferonalpha for viral hepatitis ursodeoxycolic acid for primary biliary cirrhosis warrant a diligent search in all cases of 1ss with abnormal liver function competing interests none authors contributions both authors contributed equally to the paper 
 kofi annan the secretarygeneral of the united nations recently called attention to the clear inequalities in science between developing and developed countries and to the challenges of building bridges across these gaps that should bring the united nations and the world scientific community closer to each other annan 2003 mr annan stressed the importance of reducing the inequalities in science between developed and developing countries asserting that this unbalanced distribution of scientific activity generates serious problems not only for the scientific community in the developing countries but for development itself indeed mr annans sentiments have also been echoed recently by several scientists who present overwhelming evidence for the disparity in scientific output between the developing and already developed countries gibbs 1995 may 1997 goldemberg 1998 riddoch 2000 for example recent united nations educational scientific and cultural organization unesco estimates unesco 2001 indicate that in 1997 the developed countries accounted for some 84 of the global investment in scientific research and development had approximately 72 of the world researchers and produced approximately 88 of all scientific and technical publications registered by the science citation index sci north america and europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications produced annually with 366 and 375 respectively worldwide unesco 2001 north america and europe clearly dominate the number of scientific publications produced annually it is rather obvious that richer countries are able to invest more resources in science and therefore account for the largest number of publications it is also likely that there is a statistical bias on the part of the sci as a bibliometric database since it represents north american and european publications far better than those of the rest of the world gibbs 1995 may 1997 alonso and fernndezjuricic 2001 vohora and vohora 2001 but is the disparity in scientific contributions between the developed and developing worlds actually remaining unchanged or even increasing as mr annan has implied a closer look at the trends over the last decade reveals important advances in developing countries for example latin america and china although representing respectively only 18 and 2 of scientific publications worldwide have increased the number of their publications between 1990 and 1997 by 36 and 70 respectively which is a much higher percentage than the increments reached by europe 10 and industrial asia 26 the percentage of global scientific publications from north america actually decreased by 8 over the same period unesco 2001 publishing trends in the americas using the sci databases produced by the institute for scientific information isi as well as data compiled by the red iberoamericana de indicadores de ciencia y tecnologa ricyt we examined the differences in the number and proportion of scientific publications between the developed world and the developing world from 1990 until 2000 focusing on the americas as a case study not surprisingly there was a huge disparity in the number of publications from 1990 until 2000 with the united states contributing the lions share 842 followed by canada 1035 latin america as a whole contributed only 545 to the total number of scientific publications in these ten years ricyt 2002 the total number of publications however is not necessarily the best measure for assessing scientific productivity or technical advances may 1997 more relevant measurements for these factors include the proportional change in the number of publications and the total number of publications when corrected for investment in research and development may 1997 the proportional change in the number of publications using 1990 as a comparison revealed that scientific publishing in latin america increased the most rapidly in the americas far outpacing the united states and canada figure 1 further analyses correcting the number of overall publications for the amount of money invested in research and development for each region also show that in contrast to both canada and united states the trend in latin america has been an increase in relative output throughout the 1990s figure 2 moreover when taking into account the amount of research money available to researchers latin america actually outpublished the united states and canada by the year 2000 figure 2 although the cost of research is undoubtedly cheaper in the developing world due to relatively low researcher salaries overhead and other work standards these factors do not explain the substantial increase in the number of publications per amount of money allocated to research and development in latin america particularly from 1995 until 2000 figure 2 other relative indicators of scientific productivity such as the number of publications picked up by the sci in relation to the number of scientists in a particular country also demonstrate that such developing regions as latin america are making substantial contributions to science despite the fact that the average proportion of gross domestic product gdp invested in science in latin america throughout this 10year period was only 21 of the amount invested in united states ricyt 2002 indeed this scientific productivity is remarkable when we compare it with the relatively low investment in science itself as compared with the gdp of latin america as a whole in fact albornoz 2001 concluded that as a group latin america could afford to invest a much higher proportion of its resources in scientific research and development latin american investment in research and development represented only 059 of the regional gdp in 1998 a very weak effort compared with that of the united states 284 and canada 15 among latin american countries there is a high degree of variability in publication rate as well as in financial investment in science and technology some countries have performed particularly well for example uruguay chile panama and cuba averaged respectively 68 53 52 and 34 publications per million dollars of research and development investment in the 10 years studied which is notoriously high compared with united states 15 and even canada 33 ricyt 2002 other countries such as costa rica cuba brazil and chile have invested a much greater proportion of their gdp in research and development than the other countries of this region albornoz 2001 why has the number of publications per dollar invested in research and development been increasing in latin america while decreasing in united states and canada explaining the increase in publishing productivity in latin america one potential explanation for the increase in scientific productivity in latin america is that scientific development during the 1990s was particularly strong for many countries of this region indeed this would explain the rapid rise in the number of publications in latin america compared with the relatively flat increases in the united states and canada which were publishing just as well at the beginning of the decade a potentially more important question however is why the number of publications per dollar invested in research and development has been increasing in latin america while decreasing in the united states and canada this pattern could be the result of a variety of factors none of which are mutually exclusive it is possible that publishing in international journals as a measure of scientific productivity is becoming more important in latin america increased funding to the most productive scientists from the national science development programs might have been an important stimulus international cooperation resulting in more scientific collaborations among scientists in latin america europe and the united states may also have increased the relative number of publications in latin america in contrast the decreasing trends in the number of publications per investment dollar in canada and united states could reflect a trend towards more costly research in larger scientific programs scientific impact from latin america what exactly is the relative impact of such developing regions as latin america on the scientific community we used sci 2001 data to examine the proportion of publications in the area of ecology including the fields of evolutionary biology conservation biology and global change biology between 1990 and 2002 in both the two top general science journals nature and science with impact factors of 2796 and 2333 respectively and in the 20 top ecological journals with impact factors of 1051247 isi 2001a we credited a region with a publication if any of the authors were affiliated with institutions from that region thus more than one region would receive credit for a single publication if that publication had been written by multiple authors from institutions of different regions for the top 20 ecological journals the american subcontinents of south central and north america accounted for 62 of the publications worldwide within the americas however latin america represented only 6 while canada and united states accounted respectively for 13 and 82 of the top 20 ecological publications when we examined the data as contributions to the top 10 ecological journals impact factors 1051331 versus the top 1120 impact factors 328247 the latin american countries contributed nearly twice as many publications to journals in the second category 8 in the top 1120 compared with 4 in the top 10 these findings suggest that publications from such developing regions as latin america are falling short of reaching the top journals in contrast the united states contributed somewhat more publications to the top 10 journals 84 than the top 1120 journals 79 the difference in the proportion of publications contributed by the united states to the top 10 and top 20 journals was even more pronounced when we examined it in respect to worldwide publications in this case the united states contributed 60 of the publications to the top 10 journals and only 40 of the publications to the top 1120 journals interestingly the proportion of publications from latin america the united states and canada across all subject areas in science and nature were nearly identical to those of the top 20 ecological journals in science and nature latin america had 7 of the publications within the americas versus 6 in the top 20 ecological journals whereas the united states and canada had 81 versus 82 and 12 versus 13 respectively these similarities suggest that the latin american researchers are not shying away from the two topranked general science journals however publishing in science and nature was not enough to gain prominence as evidenced by the number of citations of these researchers the latest list of the 247 mostcited researchers in ecology and environmental sciences emphasizes the overwhelming contributions of authors from north america 73 and europe 21 isi 2001b no researcher working in a latin american institution was included in the remaining 6 overall these data indicate that the scientific output in the field of ecology in latin america is having a relatively low impact in the international scientific community and is underrepresented in the top international journals despite its robust productivity as measured by the number of publications per researcher funding amount similar findings were also reported for asia swinbanks et al 1997 and thus could be a general phenomenon in the developing world although there are outstanding scientific researchers in the developing world who independently are making important contributions to the international scientific community they are the exception why in general do latin american scientists often fail to reach the top journals or become amongst the most cited researchers in their fields one possibility is that the main research agendas between both regions are somewhat different and that the top journals which are published in the developed world respond more to the scientific mainstream of the developed regions this is not to suggest any sort of conspiracy but rather it implies that the perception of the most important science is linked to the region and that because the major funding agencies as well as most prominent journals share a similar economic region they also share the same perception of what science is most interesting to them another consideration is that more local journals from developed regions are listed by the sci than similar journals from developing regions gibbs 1995 consequently there are more highprofile regional publication opportunities available to scientists from the developed region whereas much of the research published locally in the developing world is overlooked but it takes more than publishing good papers to become a highly cited scientist it requires attending international meetings and introducing novel research findings in multiple scientific forums funding these activities however requires a greater proportion of research money being spent on meetings for researchers in the developing compared with the developed world a long road yet to travel the positive trends in scientific productivity in latin america should not be misinterpreted as a reason to be unconcerned about the existing gap highlighted by mr annan there are many compelling reasons for the push to increase scientific input from the developing world goldemberg 1998 annan 2003 one is that science as a discipline would benefit from the contributions of many disparate groups around the world rather than being dominated by two geographic regions many scientific problems could be solved much more readily with the cooperation and scientific insight of scientists from developing regions climate change and biodiversity research for example urgently need the scientific input from those developing regions that are so important for these global processes it is also critical for the developing world to promote through research and publications those areas of concern that are having a proportionally greater scientific and social impact upon them there are now examples in which research on priority areas for the developing nations can actually become pioneering work in areas neglected by the research agenda of the industrialized world this has been the case for research on renewable energy sources in brazil goldemberg 1998 and biomedical sciences in cuba castro dazbalart 2002 these examples are important not only for those regions of the developing world but are also in themselves scientific innovations that can greatly advance the knowledge of the rest of the world climate change and biodiversity research urgently need the scientific input from those developing regions that are so important for global processes although the evidence presented here demonstrates that there is a long way to go before developing countries contribute a more equitable share to the international scientific community there are also reasons to be optimistic the relative increase in the number of publications especially when corrected for the amount of money available in research and development demonstrates that many developing countries are heading in the right direction the extremely high scientific productivity of many developing nations corrected for and despite the rather limited availability of funds suggests that increased funding to the sciences will be an excellent investment by developing nations in terms of publications as a measure of scientific output particularly if these publications can target the journals that have the greatest impact although there may still be a long road to travel we feel optimistic that the bridges mentioned by mr annan are slowly being built 
 there is a muchquoted saying attributed to the epidemiologist geoffrey rose a large number of people exposed to a small risk may generate many more cases than a small number exposed to a very high risk this is true for many individual risk factors such as salt intake linked to high blood pressure and cardiovascular disease and speeding on the highway linked to injuries and accidents does it apply to many other global health risks the study by anthony rodgers and colleagues suggests that it does to develop effective health policies one must understand the existing health risks and disease burdens on a worldwide scale this is a tough challenge the global burden of disease database maintained by the world health organization who collects data from countries around the world on risk factors such as tobacco malnutrition childhood abuse unsafe sex childbirth and cholesterol levels as well as on disease burdens for example depression blindness and diarrhea a large group of scientists from all over the world has developed a framework to analyze these data to compare different risks or burdens they calculate disabilityadjusted lifeyears or dalysthe number of healthy life years lost because of a particular disease or risk factor rodgers and colleagues used data from the who database for 26 risk factors and from 14 epidemiological subregions of the world to calculate the proportion of riskfactorattributable disease burden in different population subgroups defined by age sex and exposure level for being underweight in childhood for examplethe leading risk factor for global loss of healthy lifethey found that only 35 of the disease burden occurred in severely underweight children the rest occurred in those only moderately underweight the relative risks for the moderately underweight are much lower but the number of children in that category is so large that the total attributable burden amounted to almost twothirds of the total global burden of disease for that risk factor the analysis confirmsand extends to a global levelprevious research showing that many major health risks are important across the range of exposure levels not just among individuals exposed to high levels of risk it also points to risk factors that are particularly prevalent among specific populations and age groups and for which highly targeted interventions could be effective despite numerous caveats and limitations of studies like this one such analyses are essential aids in guiding the distribution of limited funds to lower the burden of life years lost to premature death and disability 
 introduction the concept of lung fibroblasts as effector cells in the pathogenesis of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis ipf has recently evolved 1 2 lung fibroblasts respond in vitro to inflammatory cytokines by producing growth factors and collagen resulting in fibroblast proliferation and extracellular matrix deposition 2 3 4 in addition activated lung fibroblasts have been shown to produce large amounts of inflammatory cytokines and chemokines in vitro and hence these cells may also have a role as effectorinflammatory cells 1 2 this capacity to produce both inflammatory and fibrotic factors could mean that phenotypically altered lung fibroblasts act simultaneously as effector and target cells via paracrine and autocrine mechanisms perpetuating the fibrotic process 2 prostanoids are important regulators of fibroblast function 5 6 7 8 9 prostaglandin pge 2 is thought to have antifibrotic properties in vitro but also can have proinflammatory effects both in vivo and in vitro 10 11 12 thromboxane txa 2 increases proliferation and dna and rna synthesis in several cell types including fibroblasts and smooth muscle like glomerular mesangial cells 13 14 15 16 conversely prostacyclin pgi 2 decreases smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen synthesis 17 18 many cell types including lung fibroblasts contain cyclooxygenase cox a proximal enzyme in prostanoid production and can generate prostanoids 19 it has been previously reported that ipf lung fibroblasts have decreased cox2 expression compared to normal lung fibroblasts and hence have decreased pge 2 production 12 20 21 because of these findings and the fact that pgs are important fibroblast regulators we sought to investigate whether abnormalities in cox2 expression could be associated with an altered balance between profibrotic and antifibrotic pgs we hypothesized that fibroblasts from the lungs of patients with ipf hfipf have an altered pg balance compared to normal lung fibroblasts hfnl this phenotypical abnormality could be an important factor in the pathogenesis of ipf materials and methods primary lung fibroblasts fibroblasts from the lungs of seven patients 6 males with ipf hfipf were harvested a from excised lung at the time of lung transplantation b during an autopsy performed within 4 hours from death or c during open or transbronchial lung biopsies at the time of diagnosis of the seven patients five subjects had advanced lung fibrosis and were receiving prednisone immunosuppressive agents 2 patients were at an earlier stage of their disease and were not receiving immunosuppressive drugs the mean age of the patients was 59 range 4371 hfnl were cultured from five human lungs that arrived at our transplant center with the intention of being used for transplantation but for various reasons could not be transplanted these were macroscopically and microscopically normal the cells were harvested and cultured as per the protocol described by kumar et al 22 briefly lung tissue sections were finely cut with sterile scissors and incubated with serum free dmem containing trypsin dnase and collagenase for 30 min the procedure was repeated twice and the supernatants were pooled and cultured in one 100 mm plate and incubated at 37c in a 5 co 2 humidified atmosphere culture medium dmem with 5 fetal bovine serum fbs and penicillinstreptomycin was replaced three times per week and fibroblasts were passed 12 split at the time they became confluent on passage 4 the cells were resuspended in 1 ml of dmem with 20 fbs and dmso and frozen at 70c for each experiment described below the cells were thawed cultured and passed at least once all the experiments were conducted with cells at passages 6 to 8 inducible cyclooxygenase cox2 expression and eicosanoid production cox2 activity was determined by measuring pge 2 6ketopgf 1 stable pgi 2 metabolite txb 2 stable txa 2 metabolite and pgf 2 production in stimulated fibroblasts hfipf n 7 and hfnl n 5 were brought to 90 confluency in 100mm plates and then placed on serum free dmem for 24 hours to render them quiescent fibroblasts were then incubated in dmem with 5 fbs alone or in the same medium with il1 25 ngml for 24 hours at the end of the incubation period the supernatant was aspirated and fresh media containing 30 m of arachidonic acid was added to the plates after 30 min of incubation the supernatant was collected and saved at 70c for later eicosanoid analysis the cells were then resuspended and divided into two aliquots which were used for rna and protein extractions

comparisons between hfipf and hfnl were done using the mannwhitney test a p value of 005 was considered significant results baseline and stimulated cox2 activity in hfipf and hfnl unstimulated eicosanoid production was similar in both hfipf and hfnl fig 1 ad when fibroblasts were stimulated with il1 there was a significant and similar upregulation of pge 2 production in both hfipf and hfnl

respectively p 009 fig 2 baseline and stimulated cox2 expression western blot in unstimulated fibroblasts showed no detectable cox2 protein in either group of cells while il1 significantly induced cox2 to a similar degree in ipf and normal lung fibroblasts fig 3 northern blot showed minimal cox2 mrna in unstimulated cells and significant upregulation of cox2 mrna expression when stimulated with il1 in both hfipf and hfnl fig 4 discussion several factors modulate fibroblast proliferation and collagen production including mitogenic cytokines eg transforming growth factor tgf plateletderived growth factor pdgf basic fibroblast growth factor bfgf eicosanoids ie pge 2 txb 2 and pgi 2 and antifibrogenic cytokines eg ifn 1 2 3 it is very likely that a complex interaction among these factors exists in the tissue repair process and it is possible that pathologic fibrosis as in ipf results from phenotypical alterations in fibroblasts that affect the normal interaction of these factors our results show that stimulation of primary cultures of human lung fibroblasts with the proximal cytokine il1 upregulates cox2 protein and mrna expression to a similar degree in normal and ipf fibroblasts txa 2 production tended to be greater in ipf than in normal fibroblasts at baseline when stimulated with il1 this difference became statistically significant the ratio of pgi 2 to txa 2 metabolites was lower in ipf fibroblasts at baseline and with il1 stimulation the above results suggest that a decreased pgi 2 txa 2 ratio could be a phenotypic alteration present in ipf fibroblasts resulting in a loss of their capacity to autoregulate proliferation and extracellular matrix production the effects of pgs on cell proliferation and collagen production have been widely studied in different cell types 13 14 15 16 17 26 txa 2 has been studied extensively because of its apparent role in atherosclerosis due to its prothrombotic and mitogenic activities on vascular smooth muscle cells 15 16 these mitogenic effects are potentiated by growth factors 15 16 27 28 in vascular smooth muscle cells txa 2 stimulates synthesis of bfgf and increases the expression of the protooncogenes cfos cmyc and egr1 which are associated with entry into the cell growth cycle 15 in addition txa 2 increases proliferation of fibroblasts 13 and smooth musclelike glomerular mesangial cells 14 on the other hand pgi 2 decreases vascular smooth muscle cell proliferation and collagen and glycosaminoglycane synthesis via activation of adenylyl cyclase and subsequent production of camp 17 betaprost an analog of pgi 2 decreases procollagen i and iii mrna expression in cardiac fibroblasts 18 these effects may counteract the profibrotic effects seen with txa 2 and it is possible that an alteration of a normal physiologic balance between pgi 2 and txa 2 could increase tendency towards fibrogenesis it is important to mention that our experiments were conducted at similar passage levels passage 6 to 8 in both groups since senescence of fibroblasts is associated with a shift from the biosynthesis of pgi 2 to txa 2 24 25 it is possible that the difference seen in our study between hfipf and hfnl could result from comparing fibroblasts of different ages hfipf might have been harvested from fibrotic lesions where fibroblasts had previously undergone a greater number of cell divisions than hfnl obtained from nonfibrotic lungs although this is a possibility the agerelated shift in pg production has only been shown at very high cell passages and has not been documented in vivo we also found that both hfipf and hfnl had similar pge 2 production at baseline and a similar increase when stimulated with il1 pge 2 can decrease fibroblast proliferation and collagen synthesis and increase collagen degradation 5 6 7 8 recent reports suggesting decreased cox2 expression and pge 2 production in ipf fibroblasts have received significant attention 12 20 21 in our study we found that both cox2 protein expression and pge 2 production were upregulated to a similar degree in ipf and normal lung fibroblasts we believe that differences in methodology and patient selection may explain the discrepancies with other studies vancheri and collaborators 20 found that tnfstimulated fibrotic lung fibroblasts had decreased cox2 expression and pge 2 production but they further showed that these findings were a result of decreased expression of tnf receptors the latter finding would argue against a primary defect in cox2 expression since no other stimulus other than tnf was tested in another study keerthisingam et al 21 reported that fibrotic lung fibroblasts had decreased cox2 expression and pge 2 production in response to tgf stimulation this study differed from ours in that a different stimulus was used of significance is the fact that the cox2 gene is known to be nfb dependent and il1 but not tgf is a potent inducer of nfb activation hence the pathway involved in the induction of the cox2 gene by il1 and tgf may be different furthermore a significant proportion of the fibroblasts used in the study by keerthisingam et al 21 were obtained from patients with systemic sclerosis which makes their fibroblast population more heterogeneous wilborn et al 12 also reported a decreased production of pge 2 by il1stimulated ipf fibroblasts due to decreased cox2 expression 12 there is a possibility that patient selection may have differed between the two studies however we feel certain that the diagnostic accuracy of our patient population was high due to the fact that 5 out of a total of 7 ipf subjects included in our study underwent lung transplantation with confirmatory pathology results consistent with ipf the other 2 subjects had biopsyproven ipf in addition our results were similar when comparing lung fibroblasts obtained from 5 subjects with advanced stage ipf with those of 2 subjects at an earlier stage of their disease who had received no therapy although the reasons for our different results are unclear the fact that we found similar cox2 expression and pge 2 production in normal and ipf lung fibroblasts suggests that loss of cox2 expression is not a universal characteristic of fibroblasts cultured from the lungs of subjects with ipf conclusion we have found that fibroblasts cultured from normal and ipf human lungs have a significant and similar induction of the cox2 enzyme when stimulated with il1 but that ipf fibroblasts produced more thromboxane and had a significantly lower prostacyclinthromboxane ratio we hypothesize that the lower pgi 2 txa 2 ratio seen in hfipf may be a phenotypic alteration that plays a role in the pathogenesis of ipf abbreviations cox cyclooxygenase hf human fibroblasts nl normal lungs ipf idiopathic pulmonary

 a brief history prehistoric man in asia minor now modern turkey or greece could look out across the aegean toward the horizon and see the faint silhouette of land their curiosity pushed them to build vessels that were strong enough to ford the open seas and reach these islands marking the start of the long legacy of mediterranean seafaring around 7000 bc the phoenicians set out from what is now iran to explore their surroundings they eventually reached the islands and founded colonies on the islands in the northernmost part of the aegean sea an important early material obsidian was discovered on the island of milos obsidian is a hard vitreous volcanic rock which could be fashioned into tools for cutting and stabbing the high quality of the seam on milos ensured that the area remained popular with early travelers the basic elements of life in the aegean began to come together as early as 5000 bc and were already in place by the late bronze age c 2700 bc the major changes were not to daily tasks and routines but to the political power base which changed regularly and not necessarily peacefully throughout the ages cycladic culture at around 3500 bc a sophisticated culture evolved in the cyclades islands the distinctive sculpted marble figures of the era are now being reproduced in vast quantities as souvenirs you will find original examples in the archaeological museums throughout the cyclades although one of the earliest examples is in the museum on paros the people farmed and fished on the dawning of the bronze age in 2700 bc they began to work with metals the cycladic culture was influenced by societies in the east importing the pottery wheel from mesopotamia they also continued to trade in obsidian and the local marble the minoans and the myceneans farther south in crete the minoan culture developed after 2000 bc into the most significant of its age spreading its influence throughout the region by trade and diplomacy santorini thira the next major island north was heavily influenced by crete and the settlements of thira and akrotiri thrived at this time the magnificent frescoes and mosaics found at akrotiri are in athens at present but the remains of the buildings at the site provide ample evidence of the sophistication of the culture here around 1500 bc a massive volcanic eruption at santorini destroyed not only akrotiriunder feet of ash and pumicebut the whole minoan civilization massive tidal waves swept over crete and other parts of the mediterranean smashing buildings and drowning many thousands of people in the wake of this tremendous natural upheaval the aegean islands next came under the influence of the mycenaeans at around 1300 bc who had a base in the peloponnese region of the greek mainland the mycenaeans were an acquisitive race who came to conquer not to trade their extensive military campaigns were later chronicled by homer in his epic poems the odyssey and the iliad the rise of athens the dorians who came overland from northern europe conquered the mycenaeans they were a barbaric race and their custody of the area brought about a dark period during which the written word was forgotten and art disappeared they held sway over islands off the northern greek coast but the phoenicians kept control of the main sea routes south of the area trade continued as usual at the same time citystates began to grow in influence on the southern greek mainland athens became the most powerful heralding the start of the classical greek period however greece was not yet a country each citystate was selfgoverning and autonomous the new culture spread throughout the mediterranean helped by a huge increase in migration from the mainland to new settlements such as carthage a greek city on the african coast of the mediterranean culture and the arts flourished once again athletic prowess was admired and the olympic games were constituted in 776 bc to promote friendly competition homer wrote his epic works on chios and lyrical poetry was much admired particularly the work of the poets archilochos on paros and sappho on lesvos the preeminent islands of this era were delos a sacred island and center of religion ruled by athens samos ruled by the tyrant polycrates and naxos whose ruler lygdamis undertook some major building projects archaeology shows that during this time societies lived mainly in coastal trading towns with little settlement inland the persian wars as athens rose in influence and power in the west it was matched in the east by the rise of the persian empire from a power base in anatolia the persians overran the eastern aegean islands and set their sights on the cyclades in 490 bc they captured sacred delos and razed the settlements on naxos the island communities were undecided about which side to back for a time paros and andros contributed to the persian armory while others supported athens the two superpowers finally clashed at the epic battles of marathon and salamis in 480 bc the persians were defeated and athens duly punished the islands that had turned against it following its victory athens introduced the concept of a mutual protection alliance a kind of nato of the ancient world several islands and greek citystates agreed to work together and created a treasury to fund their plans which was held on the island of delos the alliance became known as the delian league although there were minor internal wrangles the league controlled the aegean and the greater athenian empire for most of the fifth century bc later in 454 bc the treasury was transferred to athens and its deposits were used to finance the construction of many of the major buildings and temples of the classical age in 431 bc athens began a war with its neighbor and league member sparta although the islands saw little action as the war went on they could see that athens was slowly losing its power before the end of the war in 401 bc many islands had already transferred their allegiance to the victors who were led by philip ii of macedon he was followed in 336 bc by his son alexander the great one of the most remarkable leaders in history his rise to power ushered in the hellenistic period hellenistic and roman periods when alexander went on to conquer lands as far to the east as india the aegean became a crossroads for the long trading routes delos became one of the largest marketplaces in the empire following alexanders death his lands were divided among his generals much of the aegean came under the rule of the ptolemies along with egypt cleopatra was a member of this famous ruling clan although in 88 bc mithradates made a swift and successful raid from the east across asia minor and the aegean islands the next major power change brought influence from the west the greek hellenistic empire was gradually and peacefully absorbed into the roman empire the byzantine empire and the coming of christianity the romans ruled a pagan empire but the aegean had an important influence on the early development of christianity in ad 95 st john arrived on patmos a small rocky island in the dodecanese as a political prisoner it was here that he wrote what was to become the final book of the new testament the book of revelation it wasnt until ad 330 however when the newly converted emperor constantine made byzantium renamed constantinople capital of his eastern empire that christianity was assured of its dominant role in future greek life the byzantine empire had powerful and wellfortified cities but the countryside and the outlying islands were ravaged by waves of invaders in an attempt to counter a threat from the saracen muslims a new potent religious force from the east the byzantine army forcefully enlisted the men of the islands disease took a further toll by the time of the crusades many of the aegean islands had been practically depopulated as the byzantine empire weakened at the end of the first millennium crusader forces were sent from western europe to counter the muslim forces and retake jerusalem for the christian faith unfortunately their zeal was not matched by their discrimination the crusaders swept through the land of byzantium slaughtering christians as well as muslims civilians as well as soldiers constantinople was taken by crusader forces in 1204 and they stripped the city of manyof its finest treasureswhich now grace the public buildings of venicealthough a large consignment of books and manuscripts was transferred to the monastery at patmos before the city fell while byzantine land was being divided there was no one in control of the seas so pirates raided towns on many of the islands to counter this the populations moved from their homes on the coast and built settlements inland out of sight of the raiding parties this created a pattern seen today throughout the aegean of a small port skala which serves an inland settlement or chora making it easier to protect the island from attack the minor aegean islands were taken by various powerful european noblemen many of whom were genoese or venetian such as marco sanudo on naxos the noblemen had free rein to create their own fiefdoms the venetians fortified their main townsnaxos town and antiparos town are wonderful examples of thiscreating labyrinths of narrow alleys and culdesacs that were designed to confuse and to demoralize invaders the genoese took control of the eastern aegean islands which were considered the most valuable for agriculture and trade after a final bloody defeat by the muslims in 1309 christian forces were forced from the holy land the knights of st john a holy military force made their way to rhodes and kos in the dodecanese they began the process of building their strong citadels and reinforcing the christian faith on the islands however they had not seen the last of their muslim foe a force was gaining strength in the east to threaten their new bases the coming of the ottoman turks the ottomans were roving invaders who came from the east taking land in what is now turkey by the end of the 13th century they began their first raids on the aegean islands in 1453 they took constantinople and immediately made it their capital renaming it istanbul they then set their sights on the islands of the knights of st john and after an unsuccessful siege in 1480 they finally ejected the knights from the dodecanese in 1522 in 1566 they wrested chios from the genoese bolstering their hold on the eastern aegean islands but the cyclades remained in venetian hands for another generation or moretinos was the last to fall in 1715 the ottomans brought new influences to the islands that they controlled forming a large empire that stretched around the eastern mediterranean toward greek independence however a movement was growing on the greek peninsula against ottoman rule and for an independent greek state in 1770 russia came to aid the greeks defined by their orthodox religion rather than by historical geographical boundaries declaring war on the ottoman empire and occupying several aegean islands until 1774 graffiti written by russian soldiers can be seen in the caves of antiparos although this attempt was unsuccessful the campaign for a greek state continued into the 19th century and began to grow in strength the aegean islands played their part lesvos chios and samos lay in the important shipping lanes and patriots began disrupting ottoman cargo traffic in return the turks violently put down every insurrection including the massacre on chios when 22000 people were slaughtered the ottoman empire was weakening however and in 1821 the peoples of the greek mainland achieved nationhood for the first time the cyclades and the sporades island chains were also included in this new state a new sense of identity enveloped greek peoples throughout the aegean thus commencing a movement to expand greece and unify the disparate orthodox populations the twentieth century a series of disastrous decisions at the beginning of the 20th century began to sound a death knell for the ottoman empire the turks lost a short war with italy and were forced to relinquish the dodecanese islands to the italians greece took this opportunity to absorb the islands of the northern and eastern aegean and to add macedonia to its mainland territories following this debacle the ottomans then allied themselves to germany in the world war i losing more territory with the defeat of the germans in that war greece was handed a strip of land along the western coast of asia minor which for over 2000 years had had a substantial greek population greece moved in to administer the land but a new influence upset any grand dreams of making this region a part of greater greece in 1923 turkey broke away from the tired ottoman rulers and kemal ataturk rose to power on a wave of popular support he promised a modern state for his people but as the situation became volatile civil strife broke out in turkish cities and those considered greek were victims of threats and violence many had to leave their birthplaces fleeing to lesvos chios and samos the greekruled islands just offshore thousands of people arrived with little more than the clothes they wore putting great strain on the resources of the islands finally greece was ousted from its new territory in asia minor which became part of the new turkish state greece attempted to stay out of world war ii but mussolini saw greece as an ideal addition to his italian empire his forces made a series of attacks from their bases in the dodecanese islands including sinking a greek naval vessel in the harbor of tinos town but they only succeeded in strengthening the resolve of the population against them later the germans came in force and occupied many of the islands after the war in 1949 the dodecanese islands finally became part of the greek nation but the country was politically fragmented with arguments between monarchists and republicans right and left and tension escalated into civil war the struggle bypassed most of the islands although there was fierce fighting on samos even after the fighting stopped more than a decade later the country was not stable at the same time the massive growth in air and road transport saw shipping decline in importance the aegean islands which for centuries had been important ports on the trading routes became the backwaters of this new transport network and the economies of several islands came close to collapse in 1967 the military took the reins of power in athens and until 1974 the colonels held sway with a repressive and brutal regime many greek islanders chose to leave rather than live in poverty and terror and many made new homes in the united states and australia the expansion of air travel began the age of mass tourism and greece along with the aegean islands became exciting destinations for northern europeans escaping their damp cool summers in 1982 greece joined the european common market now the european union since this time membership has been of great monetary benefit to the country the eu has given large subsidies to develop greeces infrastructure and grants to excavate and protect its ancient monuments airfields have been constructed on a number of the islands and road systems have been expanded and im proved private investment has even made an increasingly modern ferry fleet possible politically the 1990s have been relatively quite times for the islands although the divorce of greek prime minister andreas papandreou and his subsequent marriage to a much younger woman caused consternation within conservative greek society as the balkans flared to war once again greek nationalism has stirred and there have been discussions in the kafeneion about the land of macedonia returning to the fold of its forefathers whether this will ever happen remains to be seen but perhaps the aid offered by greece to turkey after 1999s devastating earthquake is a sign that the animosity between these two traditional enemies is beginning to diminish 
 a brief history jerusalems recorded history begins with its mention in egyptian court records 4000 years ago but there had been human settlements here for centuries probably millennia before that at the beginning of the second millennium bc jerusalem was a canaanite mountain stronghold on a secondary trade route far less important than biblical cities such as hazor megiddo beth shean and shechem the earliest name associated with the city ur usalim perhaps meant city of shalim or founded by shalim scholars speculate that shalim might have been an ancient semitic deity of peace for the name resembles the modern hebrew and arabic words for peace shalom and salaam respectively if true this is an ironic name for a city that would become one of the most constantly and bitterly embattled places on the face of the earth biblical jerusalem in the bible genesis 141820 records that abraham visited the city of salem in approximately 1800 bc and was blessed by the citys ruler melchzedik who offered him bread and wine the city is not mentioned again in the bible until the time of the great poet warrior king david who captured the city from the jebusites in about 1000 bc the bible describes how davids soldiers conquered jerusalem by discovering a water tunnel under the walls and using it to take the city by surprise warrens shaft part of a canaanite water system discovered by 19thcentury archaeologists and open to visitors might be the very tunnel infiltrated by davids army perhaps because jerusalem was in neutral territory not allotted to any of the twelve rival tribes of israel david made it the capital of his newly formed kingdom and brought the most talented artisans dedicated priests magical poets and musicians and the most formidable soldiers from each of the tribes to live in his city he also brought the ark of the covenant the portable tabernacle containing the tablets of the law received on mount sinai to the spring of gihon just outside the walls of jerusalem there the ark rested until it was placed in the temple built in approximately 960 bc on mt moriah the high point at the northern end of the city the temple today known as the first temple was completed by davids son and successor king solomon according to biblical tradition although david bought the land for the temple and carefully assembled its building materials he was deemed unworthy of constructing the temple because he was a man of war with blood on his hands at the temples dedication solomon addressed his god the heavens even the heaven of the heavens cannot contain thee how much less this house that i have built the site of the temple eventually became identified as mt moriah on which it stood where abraham was called to sacrifice his son isaac along with this splendid house of worship solomon built a royal palace mansions for his wives temples for the foreign gods worshipped by the princesses he had married and towers for the defense of the capital under the wise reign of solomon the city flourished as the capital of an empire that stretched from damascus to the red sea and controlled the trade routes from egypt to phoenicia the temple and royal palace were adorned with gold and ivory from africa and with cedar from lebanon the beauties and glories of jerusalem under solomon have captivated readers of the bible for almost 3000 years but with his death the empire collapsed and the israelite kingdom was divided into two separate impoverished often warring nations israel with its capital at shechem in the north ruled by a series of northern dynasties and the smaller kingdom of judah with its capital at jerusalem from which the davidic dynasty continued to rule the bible tells us that the cruelty and impiety of the rulers of both kingdoms aroused the fury of the great prophets in 701 bc the assyrian armies of sennacherib destroyed israel and moved southward to besiege jerusalem thanks to king hezekiahs hidden water tunnel the city narrowly escaped destruction the end of davids dynasty came in 587 bc when nebuchadnezzar king of babylon invaded judah to lay siege to jerusalem when it fell the temple and all the buildings were burned the people of the onceglorious city were forced into an exile known as the babylonian captivity in time the kingdom of babylon was overthrown and the israelites were permitted to return to jerusalem in 539 bc the city was now under the more tolerant rule of the persians but rebuilding was slow work the second temple was finished in 515 bc but much of the city still lay in ruins jerusalem submitted peaceably to the rule of the greeks in 332 bc under alexander the great and subsequently to his hellenistic successors as well as the egyptian ptolomeys and the syrian seleucids when seleucid rulers outlawed judaism jews led by judah maccabee and his brothers staged a revolution in 167 bc and against all odds restored the primacy of jewish religious life in jerusalem the macabbees cleansed the temple of hellenistic idols and the blood of pagan sacrifices the eightday celebration of hanukkah feast of dedication commemorates their victory the hasmonean dynasty descendants of the maccabee family ruled an independent jewish commonwealth that stretched from the negev to the galilee jerusalem grew surrounded with a formidable wall and defended by towers beside the jaffa gate the hasmoneans ruled until pompeys roman legions arrived in 63 bc roman jerusalem after the initial years of roman administration and political infighting rome installed herod scion of a family from idumea a jewish kingdom in the desert as king of judea he reigned from 37 to 4 bc during which time he fortified the hasmonean wall and rebuilt the defense towers beside jaffa gate the foundation of which still stand several palaces were built and a water system installed herod also completely rebuilt the temple making it one of the most important religious centers in the roman empire the courtyard around the temple was expanded to accommodate hundreds of thousands of pilgrims and the temple mount was shored up by retaining walls made with great stone blocks one of these walls the western wall is today a major reminder of jerusalems greatness under herod a massive fortress was built overlooking the temple mount which herod named antonia in honor of his roman friend and benefactor mark antony for all his accomplishments herod was nevertheless hated by his subjects he taxed he tortured and he ordered the massacre of male jewish infants in an attempt to do away with the heralded messiah when jesus was born in about 4 bc joseph and mary escaped herods paranoia by fleeing into egypt with the newborn infant they returned to live in the galilee village of nazareth making pilgrimages to jerusalem according to biblical accounts jesus spent his life ministering in the galilee valley in about ad 30 he and his followers went for passover to jerusalem which was in unrest at this time dissatisfied with roman domination jesuss entry into the temple caused a commotion after the passover dinner he was arrested by the temple priests who were under direct roman rule jesus was put on trial quickly and condemned to crucifixion a roman form of execution for political and religious dissidents as well as for common criminals in a province rife with rebellion and retaliation the execution in jerusalem of yet another religious leader from the galilee did not by itself have an immediate effect on history after jesuss crucifixion harsh roman rule continued until ad 66 when the jews rebelled for four years jewish zealots fought against the might of rome at the end the roman general titus laid siege to jerusalem in ad 70 finally attacking its starved and weakened defenders those who didnt escape were executed or sold into slavery the holy city and the temple were destroyed the last of the zealots held out for another three years at masada see page 76 half a million civilians died in the galilee and judea as a result of this first revolt against rome a number unequaled in ancient warfare christian and islamic jerusalem for 60 years jerusalem lay in ruins until the roman emperor hadrian ordered the city rebuilt as a roman town dedicated to jupiter in outrage the jews began a second revolt against rome led by simon bar kochba the ruins of jerusalem were briefly liberated but in the end jewish resistance to rome was defeated with great loss of life the planned new roman city aelia capitolina was built over the ruins of herodian jerusalem and jews were barred from residing there for all time jerusalems physical existence as a spiritual city seemed finished but its spiritual power for jews and for the struggling new christian religion remained for the next two centuries aelia capitolina enjoyed an innocuous history but the roman empire became christian in the fourth century and jerusalem became a center of religion once again queen helena a devout christian and the mother of emperor constantine the great made a pilgrimage to the holy land in 326 to identify the sites associated with jesuss life she found that the citys most beautiful roman temple dedicated to the goddess aphrodite stood on the site of the crucifixion the temple was demolished and a vast classicalstyle church was built around golgotha the hill where jesuss crucifixion was believed to have taken place throughout jerusalem other spots important to jesuss life were commemorated with religious structures pilgrims came from all over the roman and later byzantine empire during the following centuries but the prosperity they brought lasted only until 614 when persian armies overtook judea and reduced jerusalem to rubble again in 629 jerusalem was recaptured by the byzantines still reeling from the effects of the persian devastation jerusalem was conquered in 638 by the forces of islam the temple mount was identified in islamic tradition as the farthest spot in arabic elaksa the site to which the prophet muhammad was transported in one night from mecca on a winged horse as described in the 17th chapter of the koran from here the prophet ascended to the heavens and was permitted to glimpse paradise the rock on the temple mount from which he ascended at or close to the site of the ruined temple was commemorated by the construction of the dome of the rock in 691 the dome of the rock remains jerusalems most striking monument it is counted among the most beautiful buildings ever created by about 715 the elaksa mosque third holiest place of prayer in islam after mecca and medina had been built on the southern side of the temple mount jerusalem continued under islamic rule for the next four and a half centuries in 1099 under their leaders godfrey de bouillon and tancred the crusaders captured the holy city for christendom by slaughtering both muslims and jews crusaders mamelukes and turks the crusaders established a feudal christian state with godfrey at its head they built many impressive churches during the term of the first latin kingdom of jerusalem but in 1187 they were driven out by muslim forces under the great warrior saladin during the sixth crusade 1228 1229 the holy roman emperor frederick ii managed to secure jerusalem for the christians by negotiation the christians however could not hold the city after they lost jerusalem a mongol invasion swept through and in 1244 the mameluke dynasty of egypt took control ruling jerusalem for the next 250 years the city struggled to rebuild from crusader wars and invasions much of the best islamic architecture in the city was constructed in the mameluke era but the past thousand years had taken their toll jerusalem was unable to regain the prosperity it had enjoyed in earlier times in the early 16th century the ottoman turkish empire was advancing through the middle east jerusalem fell to the ottomans in 1517 remaining under their control for 400 years suleiman the magnificent rebuilt the walls and gates in the form they retain to this day fountains inns religious schools and barracks were constructed but when suleiman died his empire including jerusalem began a long period of decline the holy city remained a backwater until the 19th century when renewed interest among christian pilgrims made it the destination of thousands of travelers each year 19thcentury aspirations at the same time many jews sought religious freedom and fulfillment by moving to palestine as the holy land was traditionally called and especially to jerusalem in the 1890s theodor herzl 18601904 worked to organize a movement zionism to create a jewish state chaim weizmann 18741952 a scientist born in russia but later a british subject did much to put herzls hopes into practice weizmann was an important figure in the negotiations with the british government that led to the balfour declaration of 1917 supporting the idea of a jewish national home in palestine that also respected the rights of existing nonjewish people already living there the problem was that british strategists who were fighting the ottoman turks in 1917 had secretly promised the lands to their world war i arab allies in 1922 the league of nations granted the british a mandate to administer palestine jerusalem flourished during the early years of the mandate modern neighborhoods hospitals schools and the hebrew university were built in west jerusalem the new jewish enclave but arab opposition to new jewish immigration and construction in palestine led to increasing strife by 1946 jerusalem was an armed camp in 1947 the united nations voted for the partition of palestine into two states one jewish and one arab with jerusalem as an international city that belonged to neither but lacking the means to enforce its decision the united nations was powerless to halt the fighting that erupted as the british withdrew their troops in 1948 modern israel the state of israel was declared during this difficult time in response member states of the arab league sent troops to help the palestinian arabs west jerusalem separated from the rest of the new jewish nation held out under siege for several months until israeli forces secured a land corridor connecting the city to the coastal areas jews were evacuated from the old citys jewish quarter and thousands of arab families fled their homes in west jerusalem as a result of armistice agreements in 1949 jerusalem was divided west jerusalem was to be under israeli control and east jerusalem including the old city with its jewish muslim christian and armenian quarters came under jordanian authority free access to holy sites for members of all religions was guaranteed by the armistice agreements however with the city partitioned by fortifications and barbed wire no israeli or jewish pilgrims were allowed to visit the western wall or other jewish sites in east jerusalem for the next 19 years jerusalem was two cities political and religious boundaries were aggravated by occasional incidents of terrorism or sniping until the six day war in june 1967 within three days the city was completely in israeli hands and in two weeks it was physically and administratively reunited jerusalems mayor teddy kollek spent the next 25 years orchestrating a vast program of development adding new cultural institutions and parks and instituting neighborhood restoration projects while tirelessly me diating the concerns of jerusalems many communities today as always jerusalem is a city of controversies religious jews in conflict with secular jews palestinians calling for independence many residents protesting a wave of highrise development that many claim will turn the holy city into a holy megalopolis but the ideas and mystique that have always made this an extraordinarily special place rise above the ebbing and flowing concerns of presentday jerusalem as it continues to tug at the worlds attention into the new millennium 
 a brief history early habitation the inhabited history of the las vegas valley stretches to 23000 bc when much of the area was covered by a prehistoric lake during this period the indigenous people lived in caves hunting the mammals that gathered at the shoreline the landscape of the valley changed dramatically over the next 200 centuries the glaciers feeding the lake melted away and the lake evaporated fossils tell an obscure story of mans slow and sporadic development around 3000 bc native archaic indians began to develop a lasting hunting and gathering culture by this time the valley was in much the same geographic state as it exists in today with one exceptionthe presence of artesian springs that bubbled to the surface in several areas these springs fed a network of streams draining through the las vegas wash to the colorado river the areas surrounding the springs were desert oases sprawling collections of grasses trees and wildlife many springs lay in areas that would eventually become the center of the modern las vegas metropolis for about 4000 years the archaics thrived in a culture that included many signs of early civilization signs of even more advancement appeared halfway through the first millennium ad when the anasazi indians inhabited the valley far more progressive than the archaics the anasazi utilized such formal agricultural techniques as irrigation to assist their harvest this permitted the anasazi to achieve a benchmark of advanced societythe ability to live in permanent shelters yearround without need to follow wildlife mysteriously the anasazi vanished from the valley around ad 1150 leaving it to be repopulated by the southern paiutes another huntergatherer tribe unable to replicate the agricultural techniques of the anasazi the paiutes were destined to a seminomadic lifestyle until european settlers arrived changing the nature of existence in the valley forever from mailmen to mormons in the early nineteenth century americas western territories were still largely unexplored it was not until 1829 that rafael rivera a mexican scout found a springfed valley and dubbed it las vegasa spanish name that leaves many modern visitors wondering exactly where the meadows really lay for fifteen years las vegas was used as a spanish trail waystation in 1844 american explorer john c fremont parked his horses at big springs and his report to the government resulted in a mail route leading past the spot on its way to california this put las vegas on the map and was one of the crucial turning points of its history in 1855 mormon leader brigham young responded to promising reports of las vegas by sending 30 missionary settlers to the valley they eventually built a fort not far from todays downtown surrounded by acres of farmland hewn from the hard desert the adobe fort became a focal point for the development of las vegas for the next fifty years the missionaries struggled valiantly against the dictates of the desert trying simultaneously to survive the harshness of their circumstances and spread the mormon faith additional pressures from arriving miners pushed the missionaries plight beyond recovery their supplies scarce their harvest meager and their spirit broken they abandoned the fort in 1858 despite the fact that the local land was rich in silver by 1865 most of the mining traffic through las vegas was of prospectors headed to california or northern nevada in search of gold one opportunist who stayed was octavius decatur gass bestowed with plenty of the invaluable pioneer spirit that characterizes las vegas to this day gass redirected his life by picking up where the mormons left offat least when it came to ranching and farming gass took over the abandoned mormon fort and 640 acres 260 hectares surrounding it dubbing it the las vegas ranch he expanded the ranch and irrigated the land so that it would support crops and cattle his determination had other results as well gass was named a justice of the peace and a territorial legislator despite his ambition gass success was shortlived in the late 1870s he defaulted on a loan from rancher archibald stewart so stewart took the las vegas ranch for his own true to wildwest stereotypes stewart was slain by a neighboring farmer leaving his strongwilled wife helen to assume the duties of the ranch through 1905 helen stewart expanded the ranch to 2000 acres 810 hectares making quite a bit of money in the process what happened next would mark the end of the successful las vegas ranch and the beginning of the era of the subdivision seen across almost all of western america to this day the railroad was coming and when it arrived las vegas would never be the same again of tracks and tracts at the turn of the 19th century los angeles and salt lake city were among the burgeoning metropolises of the new american west though the two cities remained unlinked by rail this was about to change quickly when it did the las vegas valley which at the time had a nonnative population of less than 30 would change as well in 1903 officials of the san pedro los angeles and salt lake railroad arrived in las vegas eager to secure a rightofway for their los angelessalt lake connection las vegas would serve as a major stopover for crew rest and train repair for all this the railroad needed land as mapped the track traveled directly through helen stewarts las vegas ranch stewart sold 995 percent of her ranch to the railroad the remainder she returned to the native paiutes in early 1905 the route between los angeles and salt lake city was completed and train tracks bore right down the center of the las vegas valley on 15 may 1905 the railroad held a land salea momentous step in las vegas history standing at the depot at main and fremont streets railroad officials auctioned 1200 lots they had subdivided from forty square blocks of desert scrub land speculators and locals alike were anxious to own a part of the newest railroad boomtown and within an afternoon more than 80 percent of the lots were sold las vegas was no longer a small pioneer settlement with rail service in place and forty blocks of private property it was ready to become a real town businesses sprang up overnight and wooden houses were erected to replace the tent city in which many of the early settlers had lived one year after the auction the population of las vegas had ballooned to 1500 residents a portent of things to come for the next ninety years dam good luck from the beginning las vegas was built to serve travelers the railroad needed a way station and las vegas was the place growth continued for ten years and by 1915 the town had telephones roundtheclock electricity and a growing populationmany of whom worked in the railroad repair shop but such heady progress would soon come to a halt the growing competition in rail transport resulted in union pacific buying the los angelessalt lake line union pacific then consolidated its operations eliminating the las vegas repair facility additionally las vegas had been made a part of nevadas new clark county in 1909 a year when the legislature also outlawed gambling these unfortunate circumstances threatened to relegate las vegas to the status of a small desert community that could no longer support its 3000 residents but the southwests growing need for water combined with las vegass fortuitous proximity to the colorado river would give las vegas a second chance to achieve prosperity construction on hoover dam originally boulder dam subsequently renamed for the president who authorized the project began in 1931 in a canyon 45 miles 72 km southeast of las vegas providing an influx of 165 million to the southwestern economy hoover dam played a major role in preventing las vegas from drying up both financially and literally not only did it create jobs but it also created lake mead the massive reservoir that today provides water to all of southern nevada more government help the construction of hoover dam did not singlehandedly save las vegas however the state legislature helped as well by legalizing gambling in 1931 and thus solidifying the future of the town though legislators and residents could never have known this at the time the hordes of people who attended hoover dams 1935 dedication set the citys nowformidable public relations machine into action they went to work on what has become one of the lengthiest citywide tourism campaigns ever attempted it didnt take long for the city to establish itself as a wildwest town with an anything goes attitude vices outlawed or heavily controlled elsewhere were legal here available any hour of any day or night thus originated las vegass reputation as an adult theme park additional catalysts for the valleys growth came from world war ii both the las vegas aerial gunnery school which became nellis air force base and the nevada test site in the north and basic magnesium in the nearby town of henderson arrived in the early 1940s as a result of americas war effort by 1945 the population had grown to almost 20000 with workers and airmen moving in at a rapid pace but this was not yet the las vegas of folklore mobsters and rat packers while many gambling halls opened downtown in the 1930s and early 1940s only two were built on the stretch of old los angeles highway that ultimately became the strip the el rancho vegas 1941 was the first followed by the last frontier 1943 during this period east coast syndicate member benjamin bugsy siegel earned a foothold as a local casino operator by 1945 siegel had become one of las vegass original visionaries planning an opulent resort on the southern end of the la highway when the flamingo opened in december 1946 it did so with hollywood flair and the new vegas flash but the mafia bosses who financed the operation were displeased with its performance siegel was murdered in the summer of 1947 despite its initial failings siegels flamingo survived him as did mob infiltration of casinos in fact the flamingo would launch over two decades of strong mob presence in las vegas freely flowing comps complimentary food drink and entertainment were the order of the day with mob bosses content to provide an environment of pleasurable excess as long as the cash kept rolling in while the mob was running the casinos promoters were busily selling las vegas as a glamorous hollywood in the desert from the mid1940s to the mid1960s las vegas nurtured a growing sense that it was the entertainment capital of the world emerging stars no longer content with playing small nightclubs came to las vegas with dreams of making it big many of them did frank sinatra wayne newton and louis prima each arrived with mediocre status and suddenly found themselves with names as big as the marquees on which they were written the rat packoriginally frank sinatra dean martin sammy davis jr peter lawford and joey bishop all in town to film oceans 11landed at the sands in january 1960 for a legendary stay other hollywood stars came as well simply because las vegas was the place to be as a result more casinos emerged along the strip the thunderbird desert inn sahara sands and riviera hotels were erected during this period luring a curious clientele drawn by tales of allnight partying exclusive entertainment and cheap accommodations there was no longer any question when you wanted some unbridled adult fun las vegas was the place to be new legitimacy organized crime was soon to have a formidable adversary in its bid to control las vegascorporate cash though las vegas had developed a powerful local economy few major outside investments were made in the city due primarily to mob infiltration and its inherent ties to illegal activities that would change dramatically with the 1966 arrival of billionaire howard hughes a legitimate businessman hughes was nonetheless eccentric and dramatic a style suited to the las vegas ethos true to the myth the reclusive hughes immediately cloistered himself in the desert inns penthouse several weeks later he was askedthen orderedto vacate the room to make room for high rollers whereupon he promptly bought the property and fired the management thus began hughes legendary threeyear 300million las vegas buying spree when it was over hughes owned six casinos an airport and an airline along with numerous plots of land stretching from the strip to the mountains hughes actions would have beneficial repercussions both immediate and lasting because of the new legitimacy las vegas acquired from hughes investments established companies such as hilton hotels bought into the gaming business and their influence helped draw a line in the desert sand between legitimate operations and mob casinos where illegal skimming of profits was rampant that combined with the formation of the nevada gaming control board would signal the beginning of the end for heavy mob influence in the city las vegas with a vision as corporations moved in and the mob was slowly pushed out a new las vegas emerged the legitimization of gambling led to its increased legalization across the us what was once a sure thing became much more competitive casino operators had to reassess the nature of their business the first to really do so was steve wynn a las vegas resident and owner of the golden nugget in the mid1980s wynn began plans to reinvigorate las vegas with a new resort he bought several strip propertiesthe silver slipper and castaways among themand demolished them to make way for a new kind of resortmirage which became an instant success wynns demolition of the existing properties started a trend that more than any other describes las vegas at the end of the 20th century removal of old properties in exchange for the potential of new ones this trend has led to many more demolitions including the dunes replaced by bellagio aladdin the new aladdin and sands venetian hotels wynns casinos have also set new standards they can no longer be just a box filled with gaming tables restaurants and a showroom excalibur the mgm grand the luxor and new yorknew york all followed mirages lead during the 1990s offering themed environments and attractions for families as evidence of the everfaster nature of the city by the middle of the 1990s the new approach showed signs of backlash with many visitors criticizing the mediocrity of the las vegas experience the latest approach is perhaps the best of the postmob era the comprehensive resort new resorts offer attractions and amenities modeled after those available in top resort cities worldwide including luxurious spas signature restaurants and exclusive boutiques additionally a handful of resortssuch as the southseas themed mandalay bay the mirage and the new four seasonsare now catering exclusively to the luxury travel market the crme de la crme of las vegas deluxe is steve wynns bellagio the worlds most expensive resort at 16 billion the bellagios amenities include 5star dining chanelcaliber boutiques and a worldclass collection of artistic masterworks perhaps more important such highend accommodations raise the standards of expectations back to the mythology of the rat pack era as it changed from mob gam bling town to corporate gaming venue the population of las vegas skyrocketed over 20000 additional hotel rooms have been added in a few short years including resorts in summerlin and lake las vegas recent business projections for las vegas predict challenges tourism revenues must increase substantially to sustain what is already built while actual figures show visitation as steady or declining the growth that has characterized las vegas for nearly a century may be facing a roadblock still the future of las vegas is sure to be determined as much by the pioneering spirit that built the city as by anything else with its new look and new aim the prospects are good despite the warnings inevitably some people will get burned in the process but others will rise triumphantly from the fray to even greater successes and that more than anything is the one constant that characterizes the past present and future of las vegas 
 dublin and the dubliners as capital of europes most explosive economy dublin seems to be changing before your very eyes new construction is everywhere the streets buzz traffic is increasingly congested and in the frenetic pace of rush hour everyone in dublin seems intent on changing places with everyone else at night the streets are crowded with people bent on having a good time prosperity is in the air the roar of the celtic tiger can clearly be heard but this is not the whole picture the proverbial hospitality and warm welcome are still here this busy modern european city sits on a thousand years of historyhistory is present everywhere from elegant merrion square to the bullet holes on the general post office its also a city of the imagination reinvented and reappraised in the literature of its exiles and the old dublin is with us toothe irreverent city of wit and charm and that peculiar magic possessed by ireland and the irish prosperity has brought with it a new emphasis

ulysses old buildings are being recycled for example the 17thcentury royal hospital now holds the museum of modern art and dublin a city large in expectations is still small enough for the visitor to see most of its sights on foot city on the liffey the river liffey flows from west to east through the center of the city to dublin bay the river forms a natural line between the north and south sections of the city this geography is important in understanding dublin historically and culturally this northsouth distinction has always been significant and it still is today with a dose of goodhumored rivalry between the two areas i never go north of the liffey one man remarked farther out both north and south are the sweeping curves of the royal and grand canals the occasional cry of gulls and unexpected distant vistas will remind you that dublin is by the sea and the wicklow mountains which hold dublin closely to the coast are visible from everywhere dublin is an intimate city physically small but tightly packed a perfect place for walking college green the home of trinity college provides a natural focus just south of the oconnell street bridge oconnell street the citys grand boulevard leads north to parnell square to the south and east is st stephens green and georgian dublin where the national museums are located along the liffey to the west is temple bar center of nightlife and home to many of dublins cuttingedge artists and artistic endeavors up the hill from temple bar are dublin castle and christ church cathedral it wont rain on you in dublin all the time

literatureyeats shaw and beckett joyce the high priest of literary modernism imagined and interpreted dublin for the world in ulysses youll see references to it all over however sometimes it seems that the city produced artists of this stature by accident even against its will beckett and joyce among others had to leave their homeland to understand itand to be understood dublin theater is legendary and no visitor should miss seeing a performance at the abbey theatre or gate theatre the citys impact on the rock and pop music scene with the likes of u2 and bob geldof is well knowntheres even a selfguided tour of their haunts traditional irish music is also alive and well especially in the pubs and there has been a revival of storytelling poetry reading and traditional dancing and in this city where literature and theater have historically dominated the scene visual arts are finally coming into their own with the new museum of modern art and the many galleries that display the work of modern irish artists the constantly crowded and busy grafton street is the most visible center for shopping but there are shops all over that carry an international array of goods as well as the irish crafts and souvenirs you expect and while multinational chains have made inroads they seem less blatant here than elsewhere many shops and also hotels and guest houses have been owned and managed by the same families for years and theirs is the welcome of traditional dublin hospitality dublins food has undergone a metamorphosis there was a time when you might have apologized for it but no longer dublin has international restaurants galore and the new irish cuisine is built upon fresh products of irelands seas rivers and farms coffee has replaced the ubiquitous teadublin is now almost as much a coffee city as vienna or seattle city and countryside in a city of such human proportions it is not surprising that parks and gardens abound for recreation and relaxation phoenix park in the northwest is the largest open space but squares like st stephens green are the garden oases of the city on the coast sandymount dollymount and killiney strands are the places to go the beautiful wicklow mountains and the wicklow mountains national park provide a more rugged countryside and the area has breathtaking houses and gardens such as castletown mount usher and powerscourt to the north and west are the ancient sites of ireland malahide castle the evocative hill of tara and the long barrows of knowth and newgrange the dart dublin area rapid transit runs north and south along the coast its an ideal way for the visitor to reach outlying sights and villages there are many guided bus tours to sights outside the city and some are accessible by city bus young at heart dublin is a young city almost half of irelands population is under twentyfive and with its universities and professional schools dublin also has a large student population the universities attract students from all over the world and this influx helps to make dublin a busy buzzing international city however young and old stranger and dubliner rub shoulders quite happily religion and respect for parents has not yet gone out of fashion and young graduates are not leaving nowmultinational corporations and european union investment mean there are plenty of opportunities for them at home unemployment is at an alltime low the irish are actually beginning to come home

atmosphere of the mediterranean macaus historic center with its colonial architecture has a distinctly mediterranean flavor colonnaded public buildings iron balconies winding streets flagstoned squares and the many churches all speak of the portuguese inheritance as well as the chinese a fusion of east and west that has produced the unique macanese culture the story of the western discovery of macau begins in 1513 when portuguese explorer jorge alvares reached the south coast of china traders followed in his wake setting up bases in several parts of the pearl river estuary finally in 1557 they were all consolidated in macau it was the only european gateway to china and through macau flowed western technology and religion in 1576 pope gregory xiii created the macau diocese covering all of china and japan no less impressive were the secular challenges china and japan were not on speaking terms so trade between them had to be channeled through a neutral middleman lucky macau fit the specifications exactly portugals resulting nearmonopoly of eastwest trade understandably awakened the competitive instincts of other european powers the dutch sent an invasion flotilla to macau in 1622 but the defenders triumphed however the end of the golden age was drawing near china began to relax trade restrictions and with the rise of hong kong macau became an isolated portuguese outpost a haven for persecuted japanese christians in the 17th century portugals neutrality during world war ii assured the territory a flood of refugees they were joined by a swarm of spies of all conceivable
